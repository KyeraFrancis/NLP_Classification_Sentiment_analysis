,Army,"Long time lurker here, figured I'd finally post.

Been a nasty girl since 2019 and it's been a complete waste of time. Am a 1LT and I don't know anything about the Army or my job (35A). The most they've ever tasked me with is figuring out the weather. The couple of times they've asked me to do more, I did a whole bunch of work, just to be told to disregard.Ive just taken up the unofficial job of going to bat for soldiers nobody wants to listen to.

I dropped a CAD packet and it got approved. Am now waiting to get scrolled. I spoke to a Captain who will receive my scroll and cut my orders. She advised she has duty stations in Korea, Hood, and Bliss.

From my time spent lurking, Hood sounds like a mess so if I get to choose, I'll avoid it. Bliss sounds better but not by a whole lot. Korea sounds like the way to go.

The sticking point is promotion boards. If I get in early 2024, I'll be just 4 months or so from O-3. She expressed some hesitation on sending me to Korea with my promotion so close. 

I can guess at why but I don't understand enough about this process to understand it. Why couldn't I just promote in Korea? Why would promoting stateside be an easier process?

She said she could delay my promotion by 18mo but given the pay difference that sounds like a major L.

,Army,"I'm summoning those of you who are *only* **currently active duty** or **retired**. 

This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.

The reason why I'm seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about *going back into the military*. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.

So. I'm a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn't bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I've been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I'm fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can't ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf'ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don't police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn't phase me. I just can't ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I'm not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you've been out for 5 years, you can't ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I'm not that god damn smart. I wasn't stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I've met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don't want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don't wanna HAVE to work if I don't need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don't even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I'm okay with the current changes the military has shifted to. I've been out long enough,, and worked in enough enviorments that Im well adjusted. To be nice. I'm not a hard ass; knife hander, all that shit. But I am about the military - I like the lifestyle, fitness standards of having to PT every fucking day, I like the idea of moving around consistently, while having a job for stability. The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn't phase me. I'm over it - It's the military. And I get all that shit.

Clearly you see my mind is made up here already, I'm just looking for some non-biased kick back on my *idea here.*

I guess what I'm trying to really ask here is. How do you like the military right now? (And I know everyone's opinion is different or going to be different on this but from the current sources, whats going on now?). Are you regretting staying in right now - why, or did you regret retiring? What do you think about my idea here?

Basically I'm just thinking - and trying to realistically have an apporach or prepation about my plan/idea here of going back in. It's like if you have your boys and they tell you that chick is bad news, but you go through it anyway and later regret it, and wish you would have listened. Like I'm essentially just romanticizing about the idea of going back in, as an officer, to end up, maybe not enjoying being back in for whatever reason. Then regretting why I gave up all these other options that I could have, had.  


Let me hear it.",t2_gp02qzmsq,False,,0,False,Question for those currently Active Duty or Retired,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18pb3wn,False,dark,0.62,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703354264.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m summoning those of you who are &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;currently active duty&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;retired&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why I&amp;#39;m seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about &lt;em&gt;going back into the military&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So. I&amp;#39;m a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn&amp;#39;t bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I&amp;#39;ve been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I&amp;#39;m fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can&amp;#39;t ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf&amp;#39;ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don&amp;#39;t police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn&amp;#39;t phase me. I just can&amp;#39;t ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I&amp;#39;m not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you&amp;#39;ve been out for 5 years, you can&amp;#39;t ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I&amp;#39;m not that god damn smart. I wasn&amp;#39;t stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I&amp;#39;ve met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don&amp;#39;t want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don&amp;#39;t wanna HAVE to work if I don&amp;#39;t need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don&amp;#39;t even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years.

We've got great leadership, seemed like his personal life was going great, no obvious signs that he might be depressed or anything, and just out of nowhere he kills himself.

I'm fucking sick of loosing someone almost every year and by the time I've had time to grieve someone else passes away.

,Army,"Good morning, Team.

Context:

I'm on holiday leave from basic. I caught up with my employer and was given favorable news. I'm in the running for a promotion upon returning from OCS.

I chose to drill out of a unit 3 1/2 hours away in N.C. anticipating I would relocate to that particular area for a career opportunity. I was thinking long-term/big picture.

After being made aware of the prospects, I thought it best to be pragmatic, and drill with a unit closer to my residence in W.V./current employer (whether I get promoted or not). I'm happy with my civilian circumstances.

Question(s):

1. Is it possible to switch units during/immediately after IET?

2. If so, what would be the procedure?

My recruiter recommended I speak with the Reserve liaison at basic assuming the drill sergeants grant my request for an appointment. I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask the group for feedback.

If it doesn't work, I'm more than willing to make the drive without complaint. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I'd like to explore any possibility of drilling in my home state.

I chose MP as my branch.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope all is well.

I&amp;#39;ve had to buy stuff just for them to do it with me. On top of any cost i had for the plane tickets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They say they&amp;#39;re doing stuff like gift shopping or finals. But I finished my shopping and classes (though I have less classes) when I was across the country before coming. They act like they care a lot about me coming but it seems I just end up staring at my phone or playing videogames unless I&amp;#39;m asking them to do something. Which typically gets an &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m too busy&amp;quot; in return. &lt;/p&gt;

Im on leave and ended up smoking, no excuse, don't need pity, just honestly need help. My ambition for myself has gone and I feel like now I have no reason to continue my life in the Army anymore.

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

He&amp;#39;s in the US, and I&amp;#39;m in the UK. He&amp;#39;s also a sergeant in the military, so he&amp;#39;s busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven&amp;#39;t phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I&amp;#39;m too anxious to, but he&amp;#39;s said that he&amp;#39;d find the time and we could whenever I&amp;#39;m ready. But we&amp;#39;ve sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven&amp;#39;t made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t know whether that&amp;#39;s going to be possible now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn&amp;#39;t feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he&amp;#39;s 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn&amp;#39;t respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he&amp;#39;d been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn&amp;#39;t be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn&amp;#39;t have a right to know as we weren&amp;#39;t officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was fine for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then he didn&amp;#39;t respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he&amp;#39;d had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He&amp;#39;s had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I&amp;#39;m aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven&amp;#39;t heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He&amp;#39;s just completely disappeared on me, and I&amp;#39;m absolutely terrified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I&amp;#39;d never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn&amp;#39;t big on social media), so there&amp;#39;s no way I can &amp;quot;stalk&amp;quot; him to somehow find their details either. I&amp;#39;ve tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there&amp;#39;s nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn&amp;#39;t lie about any of this. I really don&amp;#39;t want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He&amp;#39;s been in there way too long for a heart attack, he should&amp;#39;ve been out by now. I have no idea what to do and I feel like I can&amp;#39;t cope, I need him back.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

,Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

,Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

I was active duty, ETS'd to the IRR for a short period, and joined a USAR unit in late 2021. My contract time on the DA3540 was for ""3 years.""

Fast-forward to now and I've filed a PAR and discussed the issue with my units retention NCO, but our RPAC office hasn't kept me updated on the process, and I had to push just for them to say they only partially had my paperwork and needed ""enlistment forms, like your original DD-4.""

,Army,"Currently AD 15Y getting medboarded for bilateral wrist issues ( Left wrist ECU subluxation and Right wrist TFCC tear) during the medboard process I was in a car accident and while bracing before impact, the energy transfered through my right hand to my wrist, shoulder blade and neck. My usability of my right wrist and hand has now worsened. PEBLO has ""OKed"" me for surgery on the left as it is my dominant hand and on the waitlist pending updated mri of my right wrist to see if further damage is present. 

My question is should hold off the surgery until I get out through the VA? I will eventually need surgery on both wrists. My mum used to work for the VA hospital and knows the horror stories of veterans waiting for care. I've heard improvements have been done through the news but I am sure going through this community would give me better insight.

Also, my plan is to get out medically from army and go back to school via Gi bill and get my 2nd bachelors in advertising. I was originally going to work on helicopters components in line with my MOS, but considering my wrist issues I feel it would be safer to return to my creative nature.

Potential options I am weighing:

° Get out no surgery, get care through VA eventually.
° Get surgery on left, get out, get care through VA eventually for right wrist.
° Get surgery on both wrists, get out with lower VA percentage or possibly found fit for duty.

Please let me know your experiences and advice.

,Army,"How long did your conditional release take?

So a little back story. I finished my active duty contract in February of 2022 and rolled into the reserves. So I’ve been in the reserves since February of 2022. I signed a 4 year contract so it ends in 2026. A few months in, I realized i made a mistake. The reserves is ass. But I kept trucking on. I’ve been struggling alot financially, and mentally. I was gonna wait until the end of the contract to go back active but i dont want to wait that long so I am about to start the process of a conditional release. I know it can take awhile but if anyone has experienced it, how long did yours take? Any advice you can give me? Also if you got a bonus, did you pay it back? And if you’re married to an AD soldier, can you be at the same duty station or does the big army send you wherever once active again?

Are they lonelier than normal? 80-90% go to see family so I'm not sure that's it. Do they not want to see family? Don't like their hometown? Are they out of whack with a different routine or lost without a routine?

I'm just trying to pinpoint what it is about this time of year that makes people extra depressed and/or suicidal. 

To be honest I'm just trying to figure it out for myself at the moment and see why I'm struggling so much these past couple of months. This week it's gotten worse and of course I'm away from my duty location. I may have to use some resources that I'd rather not use. I'm really trying to just make it through the week.

,Army,"Hey y’all, using a burner coz people I know follow my other acc. I’m enlisting in the army sometime in the coming weeks but I’m having second thoughts due to the current political state of the US. I’ve always dreamed of being in the armed forces, but I don’t want to risk being in the military if someone who literally committed treason gets elected. Does the president really have that much of an effect on people in the military? I know it’s kind of a stupid question but I’m genuinely curious.

,Army,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so I hope it’s ok I ask for some lenience. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years, and I’ve never been more in love with a person. I am 19, he is 20, and I know I’m young and naive, but I can’t imagine a future without him. I’ve known since meeting him he’s wanted to join the army. It’s always been a hard subject to talk about, as I never supported it. I have strong negative opinions about the army (I’m trying to learn more, as I want to be more comfortable when he speaks about it) and he also knows this. For a long time we’d procrastinate and avoid talking about the army because I didn’t wanna hear it. 

About a year ago he dropped out of college because he just figured he couldn’t do it. He had a good job, and it wasn’t like he had no where to go. He has a loving family, a friend group, a good job, a girlfriend. But I know he’s always wanted to do this. I know it’s something bigger than me, and it wasn’t fair of me to try to convince him otherwise, to just be an EMT or a cop, anything but leaving me for the army. I couldn’t stand the thought. But he went to the recruiters and after a lot of back and forth papers on medical issues he finally was accepted. He only had ten days before leaving. And two days before he left, he told me he signed for six years instead of four, though he had previously told me four. It broke my heart. In BCT he sent me letters, telling me how much he loved me. I never responded, it was too painful. I’d write drafts but never send them. 

When he got to AIT he called, and we talked for hours, FaceTiming everyday in his personal time. It felt good. Having him home for the holidays feels intoxicating, I’ve missed him so much and every second I’m around him I feel high off of him. But I know he is leaving again soon. I don’t know how people do this, I don’t know where to start on opening up to knowing things about the army. I hate guns, I have strong opinions on them, but he has a strong interest in them and it makes me uncomfortable. 

Is it worth it to try to change my mindset for him and this relationship? I want it to be but I don’t want to lose my own morals. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? How did you manage to stay together through the absence? Was it all worth it and after their time served is it easier?

,Army,"Greetings Reddit,

I am set to deploy for basic training on January 2nd, having chosen the 94R (Survivability and Equipment Repairer) MOS and entering as an E4. The reason I'm reaching out to Reddit is that I've been grappling with serious doubts about my decision to join the Army. To provide some context, I went through a mid-life crisis, left my hometown, and moved up north with my mother to pursue this path. In doing so, I left everything behind with no intention of returning. My impulsive nature led me to make this significant decision in a relatively short timeframe, deciding to enlist in September. Now, with about a week left before I ship out, I'm second-guessing my choice. It feels like I rushed into this commitment without fully considering the implications of the 4-5-year contract I'm about to sign.

My tendency to overthink things has me questioning whether I should have pursued Officer Candidate School (OCS) instead of enlisting to secure a more stable future. Despite these second thoughts, I feel pressured to join the Army due to the financial constraints and debt I'm currently facing. I regret not taking more time to research my military options before making such a life-changing decision. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed, and I must face the reality of my current situation.

I find myself at a crossroads, torn between my unsatisfying old life, despite having education, skills, and a strong work ethic, and the potential for a steady income and success with the Army. Fearful of making the wrong decision that will impact years of my life, I feel a sense of urgency to choose a path quickly.

For clarity, I have a 4-year-old son whose mother supports my decision to join the Army. We had a 50/50 agreement for our son's custody before I left, aiming to ensure his access to both parents despite our separation. The stark reality of the Army's distance from my son has recently hit me, leading to feelings of depression.

Despite feeling lost, I believe pursuing the Army is my only choice at this point to avoid drowning in debt. It's a disconcerting sensation, as it seems like I'm joining the military for reasons different from my initial expectations.

I'm open to answering any questions about my situation and would appreciate any feedback, whether positive or negative.",t2_q1gtn6qsq,False,,0,False,Seeking Guidance and Feedback on Military Decision and Concerns,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18q3vf0,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1703451944.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings Reddit,&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I am enlisted currently, but I am just curious what the process to go from enlisted to officer is just for future reference if I decide to go that route later in my career. When I first enlisted my recruiter mentioned the green to gold program but my research into that has said that it is only open to Active-Duty people. I am currently in my last year of my bachelor's degree so I believe that may rule out ROTC, and it isn't even offered at my college anyways.

,Army,"I've been thinking about how the Army treats driving a lot recently. My specific base has \~60% of the soldiers in the unit living in barracks 30-45 minutes away from their place of duty. That leads to a lot of ride sharing, which has consistently led to soldiers having give rides in difficult circumstances. I'm all for ride sharing but it shouldn't be a requirement. I actually had to drive my NCO to work for a solid 6 months and never received any compensation, but moving on. 

There's a non-zero amount of soldiers here who can't legally drive because they don't have a US state driver's license required to apply for the host nation equivalent. Most people gloss over the word ""state"" when dealing with that, but that seems like a huge issue to me. It baffles me that soldiers are required to interface with the DMV/BMV from their home state just to certify that they are a competent driver.

A significant amount of people join the military for the express purpose of distancing themselves from their home, and that has an overlap with soldiers who, for whatever reason, don't have a license when they join or have a license that expires after they join. There are a lot of extrapolations to be made from this circumstance, but the biggest one in my mind is that soldiers who either can't or don't want to go back to their home state might not be able to maintain their driving privileges. 

Many DMV/BMV's have restrictions on how much they allow you to do remotely. Not to mention, they are generally extremely strict and may require multiple appointments to resolve an issue. This is a fundamental conflict with the military because a huge amount of soldiers don't reside is the same state as their DMV/BMV. In my unit's circumstance, they are stationed a $800-$1500 plane ticket away. Factoring in more considerations like leave, lodging, and transportation, It's a monumental task to undertake with no support from the military.

It seems to me that there is an extremely simple, albeit congress-level, solution to this. The creation of a DOD-wide ""Military driver's license"" would be an increase in quality of life for many soldiers. It could be a bona-fide ID card and simply certify that the holder is a trained and competent operator of motor vehicles. Testing could be performed in the same way they do motorcycle safety classes with a small classroom portion and then a practical test.

I know this issue isn't high visibility like mold or low pay, but I feel it's an important one nonetheless. In the meantime, I'll keep praying my engine doesn't seize up and my tires stay leakless.

I can’t afford anything. I got fired from my job and drained my entire savings just trying to survive. And it’s ironic because I got fired for being suicidal in the first place, and now here I am. Right back to the same spot. This time tho, I know better than to ask for help or admit to anyone that I’m feeling that way. That’s what got me in this hell hole to begin with. 

I’m going to lose my car. I can’t make rent so I guess I’ll move my stuff out and let my roommates find a replacement. I can’t even afford groceries. It feels like I’ve been fighting to keep my head above water for so long and I just can’t keep treading any longer. I just want to stop swimming and drown. 

I can’t get hired within my career anymore because my last job won’t give a good reference. The ARNG wants to separate me because I’m not mentally stable enough. Which, I don’t know anyone that would be “stable” when dealt the hand I’ve been dealt the last two years. I can’t even get a release to go active duty.

,Army,"Hey everyone, recently I’ve been looking and wanting to join the Army as 35T but I’m stuck atm, here’s why.

Mid 2018 I was in highschool (minor) when a group of kids got in trouble, including myself. Long story short, I smoked marijuana for the first and only time. Few days later we all get caught. I had a cartridge battery in my bag (no residue of any sort as far as I can remember) when a police officer discovered it. They sent it to go get “it tested” I didn’t hear anything back from them. I received a misdemeanor for Drug paraphernalia that day. They called my parents to the school, explained the situation and we went home. I was never placed under arrest, never went/faced a judge/ nor did I get my finger prints taken. I did a diversion program that expunges your charge when you’re 18. I completed what was needed and got a letter in the mail when I turned 18 stating my charge has been “expunged” from my record (I know it can still be brought up) After highschool I started working for the Gov and was told I need a clearance. Filled out the SF86 form and listed my accident that happened. They asked questions and was given my clearance that same day. I want to see what the possibility is for me getting a TS/SCI that is required for 35T mos ? Do I have a shot at this ??

,Army,"'Twas the night before Christmas
And high in the sky
A single, lone plane
Through the air did fly

On board a Paratrooper
And pallets of toys
Ready for heavy drop
To good girls and boys

Now Santa stands ready
Only ten minutes more
The jumpmaster says
""Stand in the door!""

Santa Claus jumps out
As the red light turns green
His parachute rigged toys
From the ground can be seen

The toys fall in chimneys
All across the land
Bringing joy and smiles
And a Christmas so grand

The Christmas drop was successful
And Santa PLFs with precision
Because Santa is a Paratrooper
With the 82nd Airborne Division

Happy Holidays!

&gt;After  years of headlines and watchdog reports condemning shoddy living  conditions for service members and families, a consensus appears to be  developing between Army senior leaders, housing executives and even  lawmakers that something drastic must occur to fix the service’s  barracks and family housing for good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Army  Secretary Christine Wormuth has repeatedly called for a “generational  investment” in the service’s housing and barracks stock that goes beyond  the constraints of the regular budgeting process, in which every  investment comes at the cost of another priority.

Ah yes, throw more studies at the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But some critics are concerned that the service might struggle to take  care of its new and repaired buildings even if such an investment were  to occur. The Army systematically underfunded barracks maintenance  during much of the War on Terror era in order to fund other priorities. 

The problem is that the Army (DOD as a whole really) loves to play the ""we can't fix the barracks or family housing because we spent those funds and we can't raid another pot of money"" and then the service either delays or DOES raid the money for the barracks because ""readiness"". 

If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don't care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn't manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. 

Fixing housing won't solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.

&lt;p&gt;If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don&amp;#39;t care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn&amp;#39;t manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing housing won&amp;#39;t solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So I'm in my late 20s and I'm interested in trying out for Army Special Operations (Rangers or SF). The mission of the Rangers seems more appealing to me than SF. But I hear a lot of people saying if you are enlisting in your late 20s you should do SF and not Rangers.

Does my age make that much of a difference when trying to decide between those two? Like would my age make that much of a difference in Ranger Regiment? Both obviously would be amazing opportunities and are very interesting, but Rangers overall seems more interesting to me personally due to their mission and specializations.

Any insight would be appreciated. Thanks!

I look on IPPSA with the recruiters I’m working with and they see my leave forms. They have someone else’s name and the dates are super weird. The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.

The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.

The forms said I’m supposed to be in the office on Christmas Day. I’m also only approved for leave up until the 2nd of January. I know the guy who’s leave form is in my IPPSA and he has to go to airborne school so it makes sense. I’m not due to report to my duty station until mid January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recruiters I’m working with seem to think I’m all good to report to my duty station some 2 weeks early. That seems odd to me. My buddy who’s a SPC is telling me I should just report in a day early from when my orders are saying to report there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What would you guys do?&lt;/p&gt;

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth.

SW: 235lbs
GW: 170-165lbs
Height: 5’5 ft.

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

The hardest part about my commitment is the nutritional side, I want to hit a high protein calorie deficit, but I work a 5am - 3pm labor job M-F. So F-M are my gym days, so does anyone have any advice on meal prep or anything to help hit my goals?

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

Reason I'm asking is that my dad, who passed away in 2020, was in the 11th ACR at two very significant times in their history:  During the Cold War in Germany from 1959 - 1963 and in Vietnam from 1966 - 67.  In fact, Dad was recalled to active duty in the Summer of 1966 when I was 4 years old and we briefly moved to Fort Meade, MD, where the regiment trained up for their deployment.  Then in late Summer they sailed from San Francisco to Vietnam.  Dad was an officer (1LT when he was reactivated and he made Captain while he was in Vietnam.)  I think his last job was Regimental Assistant S3 Air.  

Anyway, when my dad passed away I got a box of ""stuff"" much of which relates to his time with the 11th Cav.  I'm almost 62 and have no kids, and I'd rather give it to a historian than just toss it in the trash.

Prior service Marine coming in as a 35P E5. Shipping to DLI soon and had a few questions.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Am I supposed to get my new CAC prior to shipping to DLI?   
My recruiter assumed I just arrive to DLI without one and that sounds off.
2. Will I receive a set of OCP/ASU or am I SOL and required to spend out of pocket?   
I read through older posts saying that uniforms will be issued at AIT, is this the case at DLI?
3. Do I get issued any gear at DLI or is everything issued at AIT?
4. Any DLI/AIT/general tips for a brand new E5/35P with no Army experience?

,Army,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I was previously in the army reserve for 6 years. As soon as I switched into active duty, I noticed I was being paid at 0 years TIS instead of 6 years. I immediately went to finance to try to get it fixed and they pointed me to retention. 

I submitted an MMPA packet to retention that corrected my BASD giving me an extra 8-9 months of active duty time, but my PEBD remained the same. Since then, I've been following up with retention every 1-2 months for updates on getting it fixed. Fast forward to now, apparently an MMPA wasn't even what was needed to getting my PEBD (TIS pay) fixed; rather it needed to be my retirement points and a 1506. My brigade retention submitted the 1506 after my battalion retention NCO PCS'd recently, but DFAS pushed it back for an error after 60 days. 

After 30 days of waiting for my brigade retention NCO to resubmit it with the fix, he ended up resubmitting the same 1506 with no changes to DFAS thinking for some reason that it was never submitted in the first place and that the base finance civilian pushed it back to us even though she literally emailed us both with the case number and I called DFAS to check the status on it.

Do you guys think I've given it enough time for retention to fix this issue? I'm going on terminal leave in 4 months and based on my calculations, I'm owed like $18,000 pretax in back pay. I have zero hope for the army to fix my pay once I'm out as a civilian.

Need some help in regulations.
My situation is that I picked up in October, and pinned a week in. Was gonna move out in November because unit was too darn busy to take Permissive TDY and I was In ALC phase 1(I do what them days to do stuff).
November, got DA selected for recruiting as part of that scare while is ALC Phase 1.
Got magic and shoved to the right in March.
Got required MOS training in December with days out of training only myself for my critical section(no time to house hunt.

Got ALC Phase 2 in Jan and get out Feb.
Don't know if after completing recruiting I will be PCSed or not despite not having the time in service and I won't have it(not reenlisting)

Not gonna go through everything to get a place in February to just risk breaking contract  and waste time if I have to move.

Immediate leadership tracking and even CSM cool with it. Been worried about brigade finding out and pushing the issue and with every manner of rank asking me questions.

Can't find anything in post or Army regs that say ""must"" vs ""can"" or ""may"".

I’ll share one: 

Drill Sgt Johnson (fake name) instructs us that he wants each bay to tell him a joke when he comes up for toes on line before lights out. Lit. 

DS Johnson comes into the bay, gets his count and then asks for his joke.

My battle asks “DS Johnson, have you heard the joke about the three midgets?” 

DS Johnson replies “no.”

Perfect. 
My battle starts the joke saying:  

“Ok so there are three midgets all sitting around talking. One realizes, “hey! I have really small hands” and decides that he will get it verified by the Guinness book of world records to see if he has the smallest hands in the world. 

The next midget looks down and says “gee, I think I might have the smallest feet in the world. I’ll go too!”

Finally the third midget looks down and goes “damn. I think I’ve got the smallest dick in the world, I’d better tag along and see if I can get the world record too!” 

So the next day they all walk in to the Guinness book of world records office. 

The first midget walks out after about an hour and a half with a huge grin on his face. “I got it! I have the smallest hands in the world!” He exclaims. 

The second midget comes out about thirty minutes later, smiling ear to ear. He says the same thing “I have the smallest feet in the world!” 

Finally, the third midget comes out of the office shortly after the second. He looks shaken up and really disappointed. His buddies ask “what happened!”

,Army,"You’re having a hard time. Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. 

Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. 

Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel.

Whatever the reason is behind you having a hard time, I’m sorry. Yes you’re strong, yes your independent, yes you got people depending on you, but you need help too. It doesn’t  make you less of a Soldier, it doesn’t mean your weak. It actually means the opposite, you’re reaching out and getting help which can show other service members it’s okay to do so and that’s what leaders do. If your chain of command has an issue with it, fuck them. The only way we’re going to eliminate this negative stigma is by going and getting the help we need then coming back better than ever. It fucking works, so go do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t trust on base BH? That’s fine, go anyways, ask for a referral off base. This has worked in every instance. You’ll have to see the doc on base first to make sure you’re not in immediate danger then they will approve it. The Tricare referral website is simple to use and you can choose a doctor from the directory, call around from those options and find what fits you best with availability, specialty, and gender. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toss the booze, the energy drinks, and anything else negative in your life. These attribute to your anxiety and depression significantly. Don’t believe me? Cut it out and hit the gym, it’s okay if you fall a couple times and slip up, get the fuck back up and do it again. See how much better you feel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll be a better Soldier, leader, spouse, parent, and member of society. &lt;/p&gt;

,Army," 

Hello,

I decided to share my experience and knowledge of REFRAD'n. Know that everyone's experience will be different, in my case I was an O3E getting out at 8 years. Here's what I learned:

THE PROCESS:

1. Receive your last OER and it's been submitted to HQDA/in your iPerms. Only matters if you plan on a DOD job where they'll ask for your OERs


2. 18 months out, you NEED to start SFL-TAP (only requires commander signature, not 2 levels up)


3. Once finished with SFL-TAP, take the CSP portion of the SFL-TAP courses. The CSP class is mandatory to part-take in a CSP which I recommend everyone try to do. 


4. Find a CSP you want to do, (3 letter agencies do have CSPs) it can also be any business/organization as long as it's not your immediate family's and you cannot be paid by the internship. If the CSP is not a known one to the DOD it will take longer, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. It can be anywhere up to 6 months and can only be done during your last 180 days of active duty.


5. Talk to the company. Get the company/organization to soft-select you and start CSP paperwork from the transitions office. You'll need to fill out the nformation, such as what you'll be doing and the layout of the internship. (This step takes 2 weeks for transitions to be approved and 2 weeks for legal review, SO START EARLY)


6. If you can't find a good CSP and still want to take advantage of it, apply for Cameron-Brooks, Alliance Careers, or any JMO recruiting organization. They have the fastest most streamlined processes for CSPs, it's all online and mostly helps you generally transition into the civilian workforce. Know that most of these are trying to place you in a corporate business since they receive money/benefits for finding and placing you. 


7. Simultaneously, as you're looking for a CSP and started the CSP paperwork, collect and submit your REFRAD packet. It will need Commander, BC, BDE signature and endorsement. Stay up to date on your CoC because they will ""lose"" and ""hold"" your paperwork to make you reconsider. (This step took me 8 months due to upper-level commanders waiting for CoCs to push it to the next guy, which made me restart from scratch as the signatures all had to be redone with new names).


8. REFRAD signed by BDE CMDR is only the first step, it needs to go to HQDA and your branch (make sure BDE S1 submits it to HQDA/Branch/Retirement Office) sometimes they'll just give you the packet and you'll assume they submitted it to your retirement office. Everyone has to ""vote"" to let you out and strength/manning, branch manager, board, etc. This process all the way to HQDA takes \~2 Months, so stay on top of where your packet is sitting. (Note: IPSS-A was not out while I did my REFRAD so it could be quicker now). (In my case specifically due to the ""brown-out"" my packet sat at branch/HQDA for about 5 months, which because I was now considered excess strength due to declining CCC, I was deployed downrange and didn't find out my REFRAD was accepted till 1/2 through the deployment).


9. While this is going on, GO TO THE DOCTOR. Whatever you plan on claiming with the VA must be on your military record. If you don't plan on claiming anything or feel/get told you're taking advantage, all I can say is the VA medical process is 100% your choice. No one can force you either way. The way I see it, it's your personal choice to decide whether you feel you were injured enough to seek medical treatment and it is to be documented that it occurred while serving. The VA needs 3 things for a successful claim. A. See doctor and issue recorded. B. Full Diagnosis. C. Treatment (must be ongoing/more than once). I recommend you read 38 CFR for whatever conditions you plan on claiming and it'll tell you the exact criteria needed for what percentages. Even if your issue doesn't rate any percentage, a 0% service-connected is still a VA disability (This can always be appealed as well), but make sure if you want to submit a claim to capture everything you want documented as service-connected. You only have 1 year after separating for the issue to be assumed service-connected, afterwards, it's extremely difficult to justify the issue and will need either Buddy Letters, DBQ, Sworn Statements, etc. 


10. Once your REFRAD gets back from HQDA and is fully approved, start your leave form, your CSP needs to be fully approved by this point too. 

11. Set your CSP for your last 6 months in the army. If you have leave, take it prior to the start of your CSP (don't sell it, you're losing money (BAH/BAS/COLA) if you do and if you go GS it counts against leave you want to sell as a government civilian in the future as there is a cap).

Example of the best case: 60 days of leave and 6-month CSP, need clearing papers 10 days prior to leave start date, clear the army, take leave, start CSP. Complete.

Example if not full 6 month CSP: 10 days clear army, 4-month CSP, 2 months of leave (can start a job during leave to get double pay). But know that if you have a 4-month CSP and say 65 days of leave, you won't be able to take those 5 days and will have to sell it. 


12. \*\*SUBMIT!!!\*\* Fully submit your VA claim at minimum 3 months from your separation date. If you miss it by even a day, you're going to wait a year+ to get your ratings and another 6+ months to get a paycheck. (You will be back paid assuming you receive a rating above 0%).


13. You need to plan this all out in order to know what day you're setting as your last day in the Army. Once you set it, it's a pain in the ass to change it and usually takes 2 months to change. So KNOW YOUR DATE after calculating CSP, Leave (include leave accrued during CSP and while on Leave), and clearing times.


14. Congrats, you completed the REFRAD process. 


15. Most important thing to note, no one gives a shit you're getting out. Almost none of your active duty (coworkers/bosses) personnel know the process of getting out because they haven't done it yet. They don't know what they're talking about and they most definitely don't give a shit about you getting out. Take control of your own process and don't let anyone bully you. Set your medical appointments and go, stop giving a shit if your boss is mad you're gone a lot, or if you receive profiles. The transitioning process is stressful and takes a lot of time/commitment (which is why a lot of my peers just end up staying). So do your due diligence and start planning now.

Notes: 

Once you have a separation date, here are 3 companies to join. Hiring our Heros (they will literally write your resume for you, give you mock interviews, or help you start a business) all for free. American Legion, a $45 entry fee, but if you need help with the VA process, they will assign you a VSO to help you submit your claim. Wounded Warrior Project, can also help submit your VA claim by assigning you a VSO, though it's harder and takes a lot longer for WWP to reply.

The 90 days after active duty Tricare is fake, don't believe it. Tricare removes you as a sponsor immediately, I've tried calling and getting added back in but to no avail. Have a plan for medical care and insurance, especially if you need follow-up appointments for your VA claim. Also if you need medication. (I have been without some of my necessary medications for a while now due to the long process of finding a PCP where I'm at).

AMEX Gold/Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, and other credit cards. They know immediately once you're separated. They have a 3-month grace period for no annual fees so either have a plan to cancel or pay the fees. There's some good article about downgrading your cards as well. (NOTE: If you cancel your cards and you still have redemption points to spend, they will VANISH. Spend all your points prior to cancelation). SCRA for interest rates only applies WHILE ON active duty. If you have a card or student loan that is receiving an SCRA rate locked at 4%, it will go up to whatever the national average is (\~15%) so pay off your cards prior to getting out/student loans.

For the 10 years of federal service for student loan forgiveness, if you switch to a government civilian job (GS) that time will count. If you're a contractor, that time will not count. Have a plan for your TSP as you will need to roll it into something else if you don't plan on going GS. (Can be into a personal retirement fund account, or wherever you get hired at's 401K plan).

If you do want to go GS, buy back your time. Say you did 6 years, you can ""buy back"" that time into your GS pension, which is 100% worth it, but you will need to have money set aside to pay for it. Calculate it prior to transitioning. 

You can sign up for VGLI (similar to SGLI) up to 120 days after separating. I'd say it's a decent price for what you get, but the best part is they will not evaluate you for any medical conditions. So could be worth it depending on your situation. 

Once you separate, if they let you keep your CAC (the way to do this is to make sure you tell DEERs you're still in the IRR for however long you owe still), know that it deactivates in about a week after separation. If you have emails you want to save, do it now. If you get scanned at the gate with said CAC, they will take it. If you try to use the commissary, the card will not work. (If you did the VA steps correctly and received any disability, including 0% but service-connected, you will get a Veterans ID that allows you to use the MWR and Commissary). 

Create your DS Login and DON'T FORGET the password. Once your CAC deactivates the only way to sign into MyPay, MHS Genesis, iPerms, etc is with your DS Login.

LinkedIn has a free premium membership for active duty personnel for 1 year. I recommend using it as well as ZipRecruiter, and Cleared Jobs. That's how I found my current job. Check Silent Profesionals if you had a cool job while in. 

Also, if you are going to receive an ETS award, ask your CoC to do it early. I didn't receive mine till after my separation date and now I have a long process ahead of me to get it added to my DD214 (turning it into a DD215). For all you dirty priors, if you have old DD214s or ERBs, bring them with you when you have your DD214 day. It's the only form the clerks usually allow to input enlisted service data.

Lastly, Good Luck and Congratulations on your Transition! If you are on the fence about getting out, don't let the process deter you. My mentor put it this way, decide and weigh the good days vs the bad days. Once the bad days start to out-weigh the good, it's time to find something that makes you happy. ",t2_8a3dog1x,False,,0,False,REFRAD and Transitioning Trips and Tricks,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18snz6z,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,False,self,1703756980.0,,[],{},,True,,1703747868.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to share my experience and knowledge of REFRAD&amp;#39;n. Know that everyone&amp;#39;s experience will be different, in my case I was an O3E getting out at 8 years. Here&amp;#39;s what I learned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE PROCESS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receive your last OER and it&amp;#39;s been submitted to HQDA/in your iPerms. Only matters if you plan on a DOD job where they&amp;#39;ll ask for your OERs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;18 months out, you NEED to start SFL-TAP (only requires commander signature, not 2 levels up)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once finished with SFL-TAP, take the CSP portion of the SFL-TAP courses. The CSP class is mandatory to part-take in a CSP which I recommend everyone try to do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find a CSP you want to do, (3 letter agencies do have CSPs) it can also be any business/organization as long as it&amp;#39;s not your immediate family&amp;#39;s and you cannot be paid by the internship. If the CSP is not a known one to the DOD it will take longer, but that doesn&amp;#39;t mean you can&amp;#39;t do it. It can be anywhere up to 6 months and can only be done during your last 180 days of active duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk to the company. Get the company/organization to soft-select you and start CSP paperwork from the transitions office. You&amp;#39;ll need to fill out the nformation, such as what you&amp;#39;ll be doing and the layout of the internship. (This step takes 2 weeks for transitions to be approved and 2 weeks for legal review, SO START EARLY)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you can&amp;#39;t find a good CSP and still want to take advantage of it, apply for Cameron-Brooks, Alliance Careers, or any JMO recruiting organization. They have the fastest most streamlined processes for CSPs, it&amp;#39;s all online and mostly helps you generally transition into the civilian workforce. Know that most of these are trying to place you in a corporate business since they receive money/benefits for finding and placing you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously, as you&amp;#39;re looking for a CSP and started the CSP paperwork, collect and submit your REFRAD packet. It will need Commander, BC, BDE signature and endorsement. Stay up to date on your CoC because they will &amp;quot;lose&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;hold&amp;quot; your paperwork to make you reconsider. (This step took me 8 months due to upper-level commanders waiting for CoCs to push it to the next guy, which made me restart from scratch as the signatures all had to be redone with new names).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFRAD signed by BDE CMDR is only the first step, it needs to go to HQDA and your branch (make sure BDE S1 submits it to HQDA/Branch/Retirement Office) sometimes they&amp;#39;ll just give you the packet and you&amp;#39;ll assume they submitted it to your retirement office. Everyone has to &amp;quot;vote&amp;quot; to let you out and strength/manning, branch manager, board, etc. This process all the way to HQDA takes ~2 Months, so stay on top of where your packet is sitting. (Note: IPSS-A was not out while I did my REFRAD so it could be quicker now). (In my case specifically due to the &amp;quot;brown-out&amp;quot; my packet sat at branch/HQDA for about 5 months, which because I was now considered excess strength due to declining CCC, I was deployed downrange and didn&amp;#39;t find out my REFRAD was accepted till 1/2 through the deployment).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set your CSP for your last 6 months in the army.

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example of the best case: 60 days of leave and 6-month CSP, need clearing papers 10 days prior to leave start date, clear the army, take leave, start CSP. Complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;**SUBMIT!!!** Fully submit your VA claim at minimum 3 months from your separation date. If you miss it by even a day, you&amp;#39;re going to wait a year+ to get your ratings and another 6+ months to get a paycheck. (You will be back paid assuming you receive a rating above 0%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

So KNOW YOUR DATE after calculating CSP, Leave (include leave accrued during CSP and while on Leave), and clearing times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congrats, you completed the REFRAD process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

,Army,"For OPSEC purposes, these are made up dates.  


I am a reservist deploying June 1 per mobilization orders. I have had Tricare Reserve Select(TRS) for a long time and have paid my premiums through June 1. My unit S1 runs me for early Tricare Prime on March 1 which is when I am put on a manning document. I was not aware about this as on previous long-term ADOS orders, I only got Tricare Prime when the orders started. However due to Tricare cycle, Tricare does not reflect Prime until April 1. Milconnect has a letter on April 1 saying I was no longer eligible for TRS as of March 1. Unfortunately, I don't realize it until May 1 when I checked my Tricare Humana beneficiary portal as I routinely do. I don't check milconnect that often.

Problem is I started out of network physical therapy on March 15 to take care of minor pains and aches. Out of network care is much better than in-network. So when the PT office and Tricare sync up, I am still on TRS. After talking to both my PT office AND Tricare Humana, I am now liable for out of pocket costs for the 15-20 PT visits I had from March 15 to May 1 to both PT and Humana which is like $2k. While I have been paying my copay, the PT claims never processed.

S1 was informed recently and is trying to figure this out. Essentially, my S1 changed me from a PPO to an HMO aka changed my health insurance w/o telling me. I'm asking to put me back on TRS until the deployment starts but I'm told it's not that simple.

,Army,"Hello! Tell me if I am utterly screwed or if I am showing symptoms, please.

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth. 

The other shitty thing is my lizard brain is saying, ""Well, that stuff was definitely made worse with service, so go refile with VA.""

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

The hardest part about my commitment is the nutritional side, I want to hit a high protein calorie deficit, but I work a 5am - 3pm labor job M-F. So F-M are my gym days, so does anyone have any advice on meal prep or anything to help hit my goals?

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

,Army,"So I had the good fortune to get invited to the AER holiday party last Saturday as a +1. I happened to text u/yesTHATpao who gave me strict orders to STFB outside the venue and await his arrival. Just as I began to suffer another onset of PRPS (parade rest pain syndrome, 15% VA Disability), he rolled up in his car (a 2023 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat Widebody, smelling strongly of a 28% APR), handed me a wrapped gift, with the specified task to deliver it to Tony or suffer the mfing consequences. 

I did what I always do when given directives under duress — EXACTLY WHAT HE TOLD ME TO DO. 

I rolled up on Tony, dapped him up (as one does), and presented him his Secret Santa gift. The photos tell the whole story. He REALLY likes his gift. Mind you, this was after a speech, line dancing (!), and other feats of strength I cannot get into in this forum.

,Army,"Cheif recently informed my platoon that the Army is ceasing all funding and operations for our MOS of 15W (UAS operator for the RQ7 Shadow) in 3 months firm. He talked us through some of the possibilities of what may become of us, but as for now nothing is certain. Big Army was originally planning on replacing the Shadow platform in 2027 with something else, but this news came out of nowhere and way ahead of schedule. None of the experimental platforms they're considering are ready yet, so our MOS will most likely cease to exist.

Some of the possibilities he talked about included MOS swapping us to another 15 series MOS or something else entirely, getting put into ""admin positions"" within the Battalion or Brigade (basically being a detail bitch for the rest of our contracts), or equipping us with commercially available quadcopters and having us roll with infantry platoons (sounds unlikely).

,Army,"I am a German Citizen and live in Germany so I apologize for any mistakes. I think my problem might be partially a civil matter but I just dont know what to do anymore and was hoping maybe somebody has a helpful tip.

So my story is that my exhusband (E6) has not paid Child Support for over six years. Well, he has dfas set up that the monthly amount is being send to a joint bank account of us that I didnt have access to for all those years and he has been taking it from this account the whole time. Back in the day I did try to get in contact with the Army and talked to his Chain of command but for some reason I stopped getting responses so I gave up. This time I was not backing down and got in contact with the IG Office in April last year. They got me in contact with his Captain and after a couple of emails the Captain didnt respond to me anymore. I tried my best to explain that yes the money is being send to the agreed account (an allotment was set up because there were problems of him not paying before) but 1. I dont have access to it anymore because he changed all the passwords and I am not able to get a new card because it would have been shipped to his address and he sure as hell would not send it to me and 2. He has been taking the money a couple of days after arriving. So after some waiting time I got in contact with the IG Office again and then got the email address of his Lieutenant Colonel. So I explained everything and same thing happened. He even said to the Lt Col that I was solely on this bank account and i send her proof that that wasnt true but she still stopped responding to me. 

I unterstand I am just some annoying ex wife and i always wanted to make sure I expressed how grateful I was to get a response and that I am sorry for taking important time of someones day but I just want this issue to be resolved. I dont want to sue for Child Support and all the years he missed and ruin his life. I only care about now and that it works. I also wouldnt contact all those people if he would just talk to me and figure things out.
So after all that I once again contacted the bank and was lucky to have someone assigned to me that said "" I dont think it's right to have your name on something you dont have access to"" and I was finally able to have a banking card send to me in Germany and online banking set up. 
So I was able to receive the money in November. My exhusband then contacted the bank and said it was fraud and they send a credit while they we're investigating the issue. I called them right away and told them it was me that did it and they took the credit back. Now the problem was that because he said it was fraud my card got deactivated and a new one send out. Of course because of the holidays I wasnt expecting much and the card wasnt there at the end of december. So the money from dfas came and he took it right away putting the account at 0,00$. Okay great I thought from now on it will be a game on who is faster but I still wanted to know If my card was on the way so I contacted the bank and got told that he closed the account and when the new card arrives i can just cut it up and dispose it.

I am exhausted and really dont know what to do anymore.

He has been taking the money a couple of days after arriving. So after some waiting time I got in contact with the IG Office again and then got the email address of his Lieutenant Colonel. So I explained everything and same thing happened. He even said to the Lt Col that I was solely on this bank account and i send her proof that that wasnt true but she still stopped responding to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I unterstand I am just some annoying ex wife and i always wanted to make sure I expressed how grateful I was to get a response and that I am sorry for taking important time of someones day but I just want this issue to be resolved. I dont want to sue for Child Support and all the years he missed and ruin his life. I only care about now and that it works. I also wouldnt contact all those people if he would just talk to me and figure things out.
So after all that I once again contacted the bank and was lucky to have someone assigned to me that said &amp;quot; I dont think it&amp;#39;s right to have your name on something you dont have access to&amp;quot; and I was finally able to have a banking card send to me in Germany and online banking set up. 
So I was able to receive the money in November. My exhusband then contacted the bank and said it was fraud and they send a credit while they we&amp;#39;re investigating the issue. I called them right away and told them it was me that did it and they took the credit back. Now the problem was that because he said it was fraud my card got deactivated and a new one send out. Of course because of the holidays I wasnt expecting much and the card wasnt there at the end of december. So the money from dfas came and he took it right away putting the account at 0,00$. Okay great I thought from now on it will be a game on who is faster but I still wanted to know If my card was on the way so I contacted the bank and got told that he closed the account and when the new card arrives i can just cut it up and dispose it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am exhausted and really dont know what to do anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I always wanted to know is if the dfas is able to send money to a German bank account since I dont have a SSN to open up another American Bank Account. I only got onto the Joint Account because he put his DoD ID number instead of my SSN.&lt;/p&gt;

I got accepted into OCS back in August and am leaving for basic in January with OCS in April.

Here\'s the deal, I fully realize that this little ~~fetish~~ census is flawed in several fashions. Here\'s my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year\'s census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven\'t already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)\n\n* I only noticed that I didn\'t include a question asking which branch you\'re a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.\n* My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.\n* I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.\n\nAnyways, now that I\'ve taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here\'s what I\'ve found.\n\n# Basic Facts\n\n* Y\'all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.\n   * Air Force: 462\n   * Army: 258\n   * Coast Guard: 85\n   * Marine Corps: 69 ^(nice)\n   * Navy: 107\n   * Space Force: 70 ^(tried too hard for nice)\n   * Blank: 72\n* I didn\'t make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5. The Navy was about even across 1 to 3, but did have more submissions for 4 and 5 proportional to the other services. Then, the Marine Corps were roughly equal in submissions across all 5! They really are a cult. Look, real talk for a moment. Don\'t sacrifice your body for your service if you\'re supporting peace time ops. And if you do, don\'t chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn\'t earn it. Y\'all take care of yourselves!\n* Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don\'t show it that way. I\'ve made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y\'all can check out [here](https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd). Probably fun for the number nerds out there but I\'m not sure who else gets down like that, so...\n\n# Generals\n\n* Three of you claim to be generals in our midst! One is plausible... but the other ""two"" I\'m not so sure about. While all three ages match (50+), two of y\'all are AH-64 Apaches serving as ""Class IX"" employees in the Army, commissioning with a degree in cunnilingus, would rather fight 3x other generals than other ranks, use condoms 24/7 as COVID preventative measures, claimed spanking as their highest form of punishment (though I have a feeling it wasn\'t punishment for the receiver since their favorite form of supervisors correcting troops without paperwork is using ball gags), and would implement Titty Tuesday if they were \\[AH-64 Apache\\] For a Day. You know, just your based pervert, basically.\n* On second thought I think the plausible one is probably u/SilentD testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don\'t worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7\n* Also, there\'s something to be said about our willingness to pose anonymously as any of the General ranks... but not a single soul nutted up to be a CWO-5. Y\'all know you\'d get force choked even thinking about it, haha.\n\n# Levels of Punishment\n\n* You know, I think the one who listed \'marriage\' and another who listed \'heavy spanking at home\' should probably get together.\n* More than a couple of you got \'your balls smoked off\' or some variation like \'Just had my ass smoked. Made 20-year old me sit down and take a breather like a 45 year old at their first BJJ practice,\' lol. I appreciates handling the situation old fashioned and off the books.\n* There was a fair amount of extra duty and paperwork for juniors and seniors being on an episode of When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong. Good reads if y\'all wanted to grab some shovels.\n* The Marine Corps had the lowest \'None\' and \'Verbal\' responses among the branches, but the highest \'Extra Duty\' and \'Administrative Paperwork\', with the second highest \'Article 15\'. Conversely, the Space Force had the highest \'None\'. I think we all saw those coming a mile away, lol.\n\n# THERE I WAS...\n\nI handle the THERE I WAS question Clint Eastwood style through the categories of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good are tales that are lighthearted, funny, or of benefit to the storyteller. The Bad are tales of fucking up somewhere in the chain and leaves a downer taste in your mouth. The Ugly are tales that give me a bit of a cringe as I read them. These responses are cherry picked exactly as submitted; no edits have been made.\n\n* The Good\n   * When I first check on my ship they put us in an overflow berthing where marines were supposed to stay. They’re was HUGE dent in one of the bigger stand up lockers. After about a month someone had the video of happened, several marines used a singular marine as a battering ram and slammed his in the locker several times without a helmet. The also broke all of washer and dryers on board in a similar way with the writing of “broken courtesy of the USMC""\n   * Baghdad 2007, walk in fresh off the plane, Army Col looks up, sees me, says ""come with me."" Go into a section, he yells for the SFC, who comes running. He tells the SFC, ""This is SSgt XXX, he is your new section chief. Understood!?"" SFC replies yes. I didnt get it then, but within two weeks, it was perfectly clear. On his NCOER, under leadership, I wrote ""the only reason anyone follows this man is to see what he will fuck up next.""\n   * I got bitched at by an Air Force E6 for using profanity when talking to other Army E4’s (combat wounded guys in the hospital with me) told we weren’t professionals talking like that…AND THEY (USAF) WERE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR CROCS IN PTS BECAUSE IT WAS HOT\n   * \\[Editor\'s Note: I\'m not going to put them in here because they\'re COALITION and not JOINT you numbskulls, but there\'s several funny short stories about working with other nations if\'n you wanted to go diggin\'.\\]\n* The Bad\n   * It wasn\'t a group but I did my Corporal\'s Course at Henderson Hall in DC. My unit was actually on Fort Meade, MD but this was the nearest we could get for the course. They put us up in army barracks. It was so bad, rats ate through our cammies. We had to hang all our shit from the ceiling otherwise they would chew through it. I lost 3 pairs of pants and a blouse that they had eaten through...\n   * I was an Air Force Academy cadet on exchange to the Naval Academy. I can definitely say that my school (Air Force) is a college where we put on uniforms and pretend to be in the military. Navy was a real military academy. There were pros and cons to both. Navy had way better esprit de corps, but Air Force had infinitely more common sense with what seemed like very obvious shit. Case in point. If it\'s late hours at the Naval Academy and you require medical attention for anything (including emergencies), you are supposed to call the duty officer, have him or her coordinate a ride to the hospital an hour away, have them inform your chain of command, and only then can you actually go to the hospital. If anyone in that chain doesn\'t pick up their phone... well.. hope the problem isn\'t \\*too\\* urgent. The Air Force by contrast, the sequence is; wake up anyone with a car, get to the hospital, and \\*then\\* figure out who you need to contact for accountability.\n* The Ugly\n   * There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn’t have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired). It was embarrassing that no one in the Army Element anywhere could tell this SM, or the CMSgt in the AF, where our Soldiers could file a complaint to receive help. We’re doing better on the SHARP Program over a year later, but we still haven’t had any presence from an EOA in the Command\n   * \\[Editor\'s Note: I won\'t put any one particular in here to not belabor the point, but damn there are quite a few stories about the Navy\'s E-O divide, competency, and fitness.\\]\n\n# King / Queen for a Day Hits\n\n* \\[These were givens, honestly\\]\n   * B E A R D S\n   * Actually releasing for the day when the work is done\n   * BETTER PAY HOLY SHIT PLEASE PASS THE 30% JR ENLISTED PAY\n   * Homesteading\n* If a command doesnt immediately start an investigation into a report of sexual harassment, sexual assault or regular assault the senior person with knowledge of the allegation is relieved for cause.\n* Step Promotion is decided by trial by combat.\n* Boot bands not being required for some friendly bonding.\n* \\[Honorable Mention\\] Space Force Chief Master Sergeants are now referred to as “Master Chiefs” (Same response I gave in the 2020 census because this is, in fact, the hill I’m willing to die on)\n* \\[Dishonorable Mention\\] Everyone has to watch a season of anime every quarter.\n\n# Branch Retention\n\n* Air Force: 75.96% (Next highest: 7.93% I\'d go back in time to punch myself in the face)\n* Army: 29.33% (Next highest: 26.67% Air Force)\n* Coast Guard: 75.32% (Next highest: 12.99% I\'d go back in time to punch myself in the face)\n* Marine Corps: 58.33% (Next highest: 20.00% Air Force)\n* Navy: 38.30% (Next highest: 26.60% Air Force)\n* Space Force: 61.90% (Next highest: 19.05% Air Force)\n\nSo... if you didn\'t re-pick your same branch, you\'re likely to cross into the AF. Except if you\'re already AF or a Coastie, in which case you already know the truth, haha. Also, the Puddle Pirates are only willing to go into the CG, AF, or SF in that order. Zero were willing to cross into the blue, green, or red. When it comes to the Marines, they only branch they refuse to fuck with is the SF. The Navy refuses to join the Marines. And finally, the SF refuses to join the Army or Marines. Makes total sense, but I get a kick out of seeing the instinct we all have validated here.\n\nNow, unless any of you have other questions or things you\'d like to see from the data set I\'m going to look away and try to get my eyes to stop bleeding.', 'author_fullname': 't2_bdev9', 'saved': False, 'mod_reason_title': None, 'gilded': 0, 'clicked': False, 'title': 'Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results', 'link_flair_richtext': [{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}], 'subreddit_name_prefixed': 'r/AirForce', 'hidden': False, 'pwls': 7, 'link_flair_css_class': 'discussion', 'downs': 0, 'thumbnail_height': None, 'top_awarded_type': None, 'hide_score': False, 'name': 't3_18u8iwu', 'quarantine': False, 'link_flair_text_color': 'light', 'upvote_ratio': 0.9, 'author_flair_background_color': '', 'subreddit_type': 'public', 'ups': 46, 'total_awards_received': 0, 'media_embed': {}, 'thumbnail_width': None, 'author_flair_template_id': None, 'is_original_content': False, 'user_reports': [], 'secure_media': None, 'is_reddit_media_domain': False, 'is_meta': False, 'category': None, 'secure_media_embed': {}, 'link_flair_text': 'Discussion', 'can_mod_post': False, 'score': 46, 'approved_by': None, 'is_created_from_ads_ui': False, 'author_premium': False, 'thumbnail': 'self', 'edited': 1703947474.0, 'author_flair_css_class': '', 'author_flair_richtext': [], 'gildings': {}, 'post_hint': 'self', 'content_categories': None, 'is_self': True, 'mod_note': None, 'created': 1703915972.0, 'link_flair_type': 'richtext', 'wls': 7, 'removed_by_category': None, 'banned_by': None, 'author_flair_type': 'text', 'domain': 'self.AirForce', 'allow_live_comments': False, 'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alright, ladies and gents, the results are in! While &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the results are viewable with the first link, questions that have user input instead of pre-defined answers are typically displayed very poorly in this view. Also, there&amp;#39;s no ability to filter any of the results to begin to compare branches or to analyze trends.

The second link has some of my data breakdowns.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When filtered by branch, a lot of the questions had trends that matched the overall answers.

A month later, I gave her a monthly counseling and stated because she was not technically proficient, I wasn’t recommending her for that month’s promotion board. You’d have thought I told her she’d never go to the board. 

She waited 3 months for me to go on TDY to Polk for 30 days. She then went to the post CSM and told him she’d never been counseled. She had 4 counseling statements she signed in her packet. The post CSM called my brigade and demanded my counseling packet for her. I came back from Polk and my other troops rushed to me to tattle on her. 

I went to my BN CSM and told him what was up. He asked to see her packet. I gave it to him, he told the platoon sergeant to counsel her for lying on an NCO. The only counseling she was missing was my TDY, which I couldn’t counsel her because I didn’t witness her. He told me to add a memo to her packet I was TDY and have my NCOIC give her a monthly. 

She then decided an EO complaint would be the route to go. I was standing in PT formation when one of my Joes said, “I’m thinking of going natural.” I replied, “I think you’d look great!” 

I go to 0900 work call. EO walks up to me telling me she got a funny report about me. Then she asked if I told PFC X she’d look good with natural hair. I admitted I did. She said, “That’s it. That’s the report. I’m not going to do anything with it.” And walked away. 

She was the worst soldier I’ve ever encountered. Rather than prove to me she could do her job at the rate of an NCO, she proved she was petty and childish and deserved to wear that sham shield. I certainly wasn’t promoting her ahead of my super star soldiers who excelled at their job while she didn’t even know how to fill out basic forms.

In a sort of blessing they charted it badly and it was written in my chart as &amp;quot;headache&amp;quot; and the scans and neurology follow up is missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m planning on joining the military next year after my bachelors degree is wrapped up but I&amp;#39;m worried, would the genesis system catch and disqualify me over something like that?&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I just purchased this jacket in honor of the closest thing I ever had to a father. He was army special forces airborne and my little sisters biological father. He would often take me on the weekend at 4:00 a.m. to ""Jump Zone"" as he called it here in the deserts of Arizona. Growing up without a father and having him in my life we're the best moments of my childhood. He taught me how to fight, how to shoot, He even taught me how to sword fight in both Kendo and Fencing styles. His name was Michael Barber, and unfortunately he passed away during a parachuting accident. He was doing a stunt for the Bruce Willis movie ""Tears of the Sun"".
He was hit by a gust of wind and got wrapped in his chute and fell into the ocean. I just hope with his expertise he understood his situation and was able to find peace on his way down. The only way I can comfort myself about the situation is knowing he went out doing what he loved most....And hoping it was somehow peaceful and quick 😞

Anyway I don't know much about his rank, or even his time served. But as soon as I saw this jacket I knew I had to buy it. I've been thinking A LOT about him as I recently just got back into firearms training and he was the one who first taught me how to shoot. So I remember everything I can about his lessons and it's actually been quite helpful even all these years later. I know that he trained troops for Saudi Arabia, or trained troops in Saudi Arabia... I'm not sure if they were actual Saudi troops or not. I remember him telling me he actually spent a lot of time and Saudi civilian clothing because he could pass as Saudi Arabian. I think he also worked with the Mujahideen because he would talk a lot about them and he showed me how to sneak around in the mountains like they did. Sorry I've gotten WAAAY of topic. 

To anyone still reading thank you very much for allowing me to reminisce. 

If anyone has any information on this style of camouflage I would greatly appreciate it. Sorry for the long tangent. And Thanks again for anyone who has read this and is willing to help.

,Army,"Happy New Year!

I will have completed my MSO in May '24 and submitted my UQR to leave in June '24.

However this year the unit is supposed to get TCS orders to do something irrelevant to our actual job as a Battalion at a stateside installation in August for a year. I have a great job that I just took that will propel my career and income upward.

I've been pretty vocal that I will not join the unit when they go, as I submitted a UQR but so are many of the other officers who want to go IRR or trying to get out of it (some are still within their MSO).


Got a new BC I haven't spoke to yet due to the limited time at BA and the holidays but I've notified the previous BN CDR and the HHC CDR for their knowledge when I submitted the packet for S1. As far as I know no one has been interviewed as to explain why they can't go as well as a roster scrub hasn't been conducted for whos going.


I've looked up AR 135-175 and the Request for Resignation Unqualified sharepoint  and can't find the answer whether if I can still UQR if whatever reason I get orders or if I'm even eligible to get orders because my MSO ends in May.

,Army,"This is a safe place to ask any question related to joining the Army. It is focused on joining, Basic Combat Training (BCT) and Advanced Individual Training (AIT), and follow on schools, such as Airborne, Air Assault, Ranger Assessment and Selection Program (RASP), and any other Additional Skill Identifiers (ASI).

We ask that you do some research on your own, as joining the Army is a big commitment and shouldn't be taken lightly. Resources such as [GoArmy.com](https://www.goarmy.com/), the [Army Reenlistment site](http://www.armyreenlistment.com/), [Bootcamp4Me](http://bootcamp4me.com/), Google and the Reddit search function are at your disposal. There's also the [/r/army wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/wiki/index). It has a lot of the frequent topics, and it's expanding all the time.

/r/militaryfaq is open to broad joining questions or answers from different branches.
Make sure you check out the /Army [Duty Station Thread Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/8u44b7/duty_station_thread_miscellaneous_general/), and our ongoing [MOS Megathread Series](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/9knq72/mos_megathread_series_cmf_35_military/).

,Army," 

Long post ahead of feeling sorry for myself, but I have to vent.

My ETS is in January of 2026.

I am so damn sick and tired of being in the military and the Army I don't know what to do. I've been diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, but I probably have worse problems with my head than that.

I am a shit bag soldier. I'll admit it. I enlisted way older than what I should have joined. Wish I had joined the Air Force but I would have been a shitbag there too, but at least I wouldn't have to worry about the field, group PT, staying in the barracks as an unmarried E4, etc. I have one of the worst jobs in the military, tried to reclass, and failed my reclass, now I'm back to the MOS I tried to escape from.

I've been in since October of 2017. Six years now. Despite getting a company grade article 15 in May of 2018 (smoked in the barracks) I was somehow considered decent enough at my first unit to be given a specialist waiver at my 18 month mark, May of 2019. I haven't been in trouble since then but I'm still a shitbag. I have been a specialist since then.

My next unit (interpost transfer) basically screwed me over repeatedly and just neglected me. Even the first sergeant knew what was going on, so coming to him wasn't going to do a damn thing. Didn't even process my PCS award and when I asked for it, they said ""you'll get it."" They never did process it.

I was told at my three year mark when I was in Greece that I would go to the promotion board. That came and went and I never did go. My last six months at my unit before I reenlisted, I was given AT LEAST SEVEN non-recommendation counsellings and was passed around to a new E5 almost every month, who would then tell me that I hadn't been under them long enough to be recommended. I would have been sent to at least one more E5 if I hadn't left my unit when I did, because my last E5 was getting out. One staff sergeant I had told me ""just because you've been in for over four years, doesn't mean you should go to the board"", and then my retention sergeant told me that that E6 came to him and asked if there was a way to bar me from reenlistment.

Over four and a half years of being a specialist now, and I have still never been recommended for the promotion board.

All these people who were E2's, and even people who weren't even in the Army when I joined, are now E5's while I'm still an unpromatable E4.    I know there's people who've been in for six years who are now E6's or E5 promotables, while I'm still an unpromotable E4 after over four and a half years time in grade and six years time in service.  Whatever.   I get it, there's something very, very wrong with ME, and this just isn't for me. I was trying to reclass so I could have something to fall back one when I got out, and I was trying to reclass to something that was a little ""less Army"" but that blew up in my pathetic face.

**I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of my MOS, I'm tired of the military, and I am just tired of the Army.** I still have nightmares about bad experiences I've had (being in a group of trainees in basic where one guy broke his neck, being with a guy on my MOS with a fire and watching him get burned, myself being burned by an asshole who wasn't paying attention and then blamed me, being grabbed in the balls on duty from behind, etc.. and I still think about failing my AIT when I tried to reclass.)

Now I just show up at the right place and time and uniform and that's it now.

The military and the Army with the morning PT, barracks, field, etc. just isn't for me. I can't wait to just get the fuck out. Take my honorable discharge and just go. If I never do make sergeant, then whatever.  Fuck this. I was told a few years ago ""you'll never be a NCO, never. And ""you don't deserve to be in the Army"" That's fine now. I don't care anymore. All I care about now is finishing my time and preparing to get out.   

I don't want to try to reclass again because for one, I don't want to deal with the extra stupid rules the Army has on even prior service, ON TOP of the general military nonsense (It pissed me off when I had prior service Air Force guys tell me they didn't have to stay in barracks and they did PT on their own, while we prior service Army still had to stay in barracks and do PT and deal with random formations called upon by drill sergeants even in the evening over stupid shit somebody else did.) and 2), I don't want to risk failing the AIT and then I'm RIGHT BACK to my MOS.

After my long post of feeling sorry for myself, my question is, I've heard different things about when SFL TAP starts. Some of have told me it is 18 months, while others have said no, it's 12 months. Who's correct?",t2_ga7j9zy22,False,,0,False,is SFL TAP 18 months or 12 months?,[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18vojsj,False,dark,0.27,,public,0,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1704081740.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long post ahead of feeling sorry for myself, but I have to vent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I just show up at the right place and time and uniform and that&amp;#39;s it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military and the Army with the morning PT, barracks, field, etc. just isn&amp;#39;t for me. I can&amp;#39;t wait to just get the fuck out. Take my honorable discharge and just go. If I never do make sergeant, then whatever.  Fuck this. I was told a few years ago &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;ll never be a NCO, never. And &amp;quot;you don&amp;#39;t deserve to be in the Army&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s fine now. I don&amp;#39;t care anymore. All I care about now is finishing my time and preparing to get out.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to try to reclass again because for one, I don&amp;#39;t want to deal with the extra stupid rules the Army has on even prior service, ON TOP of the general military nonsense (It pissed me off when I had prior service Air Force guys tell me they didn&amp;#39;t have to stay in barracks and they did PT on their own, while we prior service Army still had to stay in barracks and do PT and deal with random formations called upon by drill sergeants even in the evening over stupid shit somebody else did.) and 2), I don&amp;#39;t want to risk failing the AIT and then I&amp;#39;m RIGHT BACK to my MOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After my long post of feeling sorry for myself, my question is, I&amp;#39;ve heard different things about when SFL TAP starts. Some of have told me it is 18 months, while others have said no, it&amp;#39;s 12 months. Who&amp;#39;s correct?&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So, recently I re-enlisted in the NG while deployed, I was in the Kuwait/Jordan Area, and I was re-assured that my bonus would be tax free. I re-enlisted under the idea that I would get a lump sum payment, and that sounded good to me. The bonus was 20k in total.  


Clearly I am posting here cause was because I didn't get 20k. Now, to be fair to the Guard, the total was 20k, truly a lump sum payment. However I am wondering how I might resolve 2 things:  
1: 3k of it went straight to my TSP. I didn't even think that my TSP would take some, and I'm not against putting some in there, but I'm not wanting to put 3k in. I don't get the payout for a few days, can I go ahead and adjust my TSP today and then receive more in hand, OR is it solidified cause I see it in MyPay? How can I go about getting those funds if so?  


2: I got taxed nearly 5k, which, I heard happens. I've heard varied responses such as, ""Submit a copy of your orders/your re-enlistment orders/bonus to finance and wait for your 5k back,"" to, ""You gotta wait till tax time, you'll get it back,"" which because my payout is the 4th of Jan, won't be till next year.

,Army,"Hey hi howdy! Another long post!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a very holiday oriented person. I legitimately forget holidays are coming up and could not tell you the date of any holiday besides probably July 5th (Huehue). But there is one holiday I never forget, and it could maybe be because it's literally impossible. Like you may forget how many inches are on a ruler, but you definitely know what number it starts with; 0. That's New Years. I fucking love New Years, it a hard set date that marks time progressing forward. Each year is a race to try and do as much as possible before the end of that 20– number. It gets me in this weird philosophical mindset where I dread and embrace the passage of time. Something about changing the year I wrote by muscle memory all year as it was unchanging and concrete, the old one being one I will never write with the same mentality ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

The year that was once the mark of cutting edge modernity,

“um It is literally 2023,  how are we still doing this, get with the times 💅”

&amp;#x200B;

Becomes old, dated, and represents some defining moment of that year we are now moving forward from, moving on. It's now 2024 and we are barreling towards a new great defining moment that we can't predict or plan for.  What's going to be the Defining Moment for humanity? the moment for America? What's going to be the Defining Moment for you?

&amp;#x200B;

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

&amp;#x200B;

I am still a baby faced innocent young man of 23, so years aren't zooming by yet. These things take forever to pass. And I feel like I am a different person at the end of each one. But this year in particular has been the most unending, mindwarpingly, soul-testingly long 365 days of my life. I cannot put it in my head that so much happened in this year, it feels like 4. Every month I am a whole new person, and often at a whole new place in life it seems. I used to do posts here only after every significant developments and achievements happened, but it got to a point that if I kept that up, I'd be posting every week or twice a week and nobody wants that.

&amp;#x200B;

Both to help me get the story straight in my head and to send off the craziest year of my life, here's a wrap up of my 2023. What's yours?

&amp;#x200B;

**THE BEGINNING OF MY YEAR.**

&amp;#x200B;

*One of the most challenging and awful months of my life. I will explain it in extreme detail because it was incredibly difficult and I never posted openly about all of it. Covers me almost dying, me creating the first real army bone marrow program, me joining the boss executive council and getting fired from the executive council.*

&amp;#x200B;

**January 1st -** Started my job with the Bliss BOSS executive council along with two others, we were all collectively going to fully replace the current council.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 15th** \- [I began a two week long marrow donor registry drive at WBAMC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/10ixiaa/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_22_yo_spc_currently/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Sourced soldiers to help from my brigade CSM who gave me 6 from different units each day. I did two shifts with 3 in the morning and three in the afternoon, 14 hours total each day. Each day I had to train, manage, and watch the team.  As well as source and ensure I had my team for the next day. I was walking well over 8 miles a day between all my tables and averaging 70+ calls a day managing the team, hospital staff, and sourcing, while also doing my job with BOSS remotely.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 25th -** I did a local news interview, as well as an interview with Army Magazine. Right after I started feeling sick. Progressively getting worse until I had to spend the last 4 hours of the day passed out on a table in an empty conference room I had claimed as my HQ. That same week my [taskandpurpose article](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlissBoneMarrowGuy/comments/10gnj08/task_and_purpose/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) came out finally. It was a big week.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 26th -**  I woke up that morning ungodly sick, I absolutely could not speak.  I texted and told one of my trusted guys that he is going to have to handle today on his own. I wasn't going to make it in. I texted my POC for the hospital, a MSG who reached out on Reddit and made the whole detail possible and let her know. She told me I was dumb if I did not go to the ER and get some meds. I was literally vomiting phlegm every couple minutes and had a 105 temperature and getting worse. I was completely delirious and managed to barely text one of my friends to take me to the E.R. Within an hour I was on a breathing tube and getting emergency surgery. I was just told they were removing my tonsils and draining the extreme swelling. It was so bad they had to put the tube in while I was awake, then immediately put me to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 30th -** [I woke up in the ICU covered in tubes and bruises.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/10qevmd/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_another_post_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I was told I had the worst case of a very rare case of tonsillitis called periodontal tonsillitis they'd ever seen. I would have died that day from my throat closing up had I not gone to the E.R. when I did. It took 6 people to hold me down to get the tube in and I almost bit through it, as well as the surgeon's finger when he tried to pry my mouth open. They almost had to do a chest trach. They also had lost my phone in the struggle when it was launched across the room. Took two days for them to find it and my friends and partner having no clue what happened to me. I lost 17 pounds and had acquired some extreme body dysmorphia and muscle dystrophy. My number two guy who I had basically abandoned with only a “you gotta handle today” 5 days prior had continued on with running the hospital drive in my place with no further information from me or any clue what happened. He handled the final two days with no supply refills and no way to actually contact the next day's detail members. But he did what he could. That drive registered 685 people and more than tripled the previous records for hospital registry drives in military history.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 2nd -** I leave the hospital and have to go right back to work. Having learned while I was being recognized by the CG the next day, and going through every drug withdrawal on the planet at the time from what the hospital had me on. It was a rough day. Spent all night sick, achey, and with massive mood swings from the steroid shot withdrawals. Barely fell asleep 2 hours before my wake up time.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 3rd -** Woke up early, got in trouble with the BOSS council for missing my up-text by 3 minutes. I had to make a huge power move today, I almost died and with that, all my efforts gone to nothing. Before today my work was only ever a hobby, with no real goal of where to go with it. [I spent 6 hours that morning typing up and designing a 37 page continuity book, finding a printer, binder, and page protector. I finished minutes before the ceremony, and when the CG gave me my ARCOM, I gave him a challenge coin and the continuity book right back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/12jtz4k/spc_awards_1st_armoured_divisions_2_star/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Saying “With this you can make Fort Bliss the center of marrow donations for the Army for decades to come” and requested a contact at division to help make this effort permanent. He told me he has a division surgeon cell that may be qualified.

I wobbled back home, almost passing out every other step from how weak I was. I expected nothing to come from this.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 16th -** [Today I was invited to attend the ironclad meeting. Basically every single commander and CSM on post gathers each month in one building.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13ie3jo/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_fort_bliss_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I was there to award them this huge sculpted wood femur bone trophy I had been making for almost a year for their (my) achievements for donations. I had gotten no further information from the CG so I had another power move ready to go. My killer right hand man from the hospital drive agreed to help me get ready. We assembled 5 more binders of continuity books and planned to hand them out in the wide open to every medical officer right in front of the division leadership. I expected nothing to come from this either. We were scrambling around trying to buy the stuff. I was at the PX frowning over binder prices and we was off at a print shop when I got a call from the division surgeon cell SGM. He told me they were tasked to work with me to create the OPORD for making my continuity book a full program across Fort Bliss. I dropped to the floor in the middle of the shoppette. We finished the books, awarded the trophy and went on with our day. Once I got in my car later to go get a beer and celebrate it all hit me, and I spent the entire drive and a long time in the parking lot screaming, punching the steering wheel and crying tears of joy for the first time in my life. It was all worth it. All my pain and losses and illness. Once I got my health back, I began obsessing over the gym and eating. Putting on 20 pounds in 3 weeks and eating over 4K calories a day to get back what I lost. I had bought dress pants, chinos and such, after I got out the hospital when I was still dilapidatley skinny for my job at BOSS and put so much muscle on my butt and thighs so quickly I popped the buttons off or tore the back pockets of every single pair of those pants.

&amp;#x200B;

**February - March -** I began building my OPORD for the program with the division surgeon. Pouring my self entirely into my job at BOSS. Obsessing over finding and networking businesses to work with us to have consistent and long term volunteer events with unique places of need within the city. Special needs schools, nursing homes, movie nights at homeless shelters, soul kitchens and pantrys, etc. as well as chess clubs around the city, D&amp;D nights, horse riding, and other things. I wanted the soldiers who never leave the barracks to join events that fit their interests.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned excel and rebuilt [the backend tracking system for BOSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13lb194/i_redesigned_the_fort_bliss_boss_programs_entire/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to allow us to track which brigades are signing up for events and which are not, located and tied in every BOSS rep since the system was completely out of date, and developed ways to keep these reps accountable for ensuring soldiers know about our events.

&amp;#x200B;

**March 16th -** had to get my left shoulder totally reconstructed. My arm and years old grappling injuries and new army injuries had caused it to start dislocating in my sleep. It dislocated around 23 times in the year since I had been at Bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

**April -** recovery from surgery, personal losses. Personal Struggles and professional differences with the new president of BOSS. Feeling like it was time to let BoneMarrowGuy die since there was no further I could go. I was making a division wide permanent program and that's as far as my potential to make a difference. Maybe other divisions will follow, maybe not.

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of the month I was facing down serious burnout from everything, those differences at work were so bad I was beginning to document every single things I did every day to the minute. Every conversation and task completed or progressed or failed. I couldn't figure it out and just dived more into even more of a OCD routine to make it work. I was smoking a pack of black and mild's and two beers a day as my only vice.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 2nd -** I was facing down serious burnout, I was making plans to take advantage of a three day weekend to get a bunch of friends and get an AirBnb in the mountain forest two hours away and just take a rest. That day I had invited two great friends to join me and some others to come up. I hadn't kept nearly as close as I should have with them but they told me they wanted to start hanging out again. Two roommates who were absolutely inseparable, literally together 24/7 or on the phone. That night I was at my partners house and got a call from my NCO asking if I was okay, because there were a bunch of MPs and an ambulance at the barracks. I figured another rowdy combat engineer night or someone burned a pizza again. Or maybe something else.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 3rd -** At 1300 I got curious and called a friend of mine while at work. I casually asked “was it a suicide” he said yes and I asked with disconnected attention if he knew who. He said it was my friend, the one I had spoken to yesterday. I fuckin ran out of the office and immediately started calling trying to figure out where her friend was. I got a hold of their 1SG and was told she was in the hospital and would be back soon. I went to the store and bought every goddamn grocery, cooked days of meal prep and waited until I was told she got back and dropped it all off at her door.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 4th -** that night I stayed up all night with a SSG from my company talking to him about how to deal with it. I had a mason jar with the fanciest rum drink on the planet, chopped up fruit garnish everything. I finally went to bed at 4AM with it untouched next to me. Overslept by hours because my phone had died with my partner on the line. Woke up to a knock at my door, it was the BOSS president. I was fired an hour later by phone call.

&amp;#x200B;

I went up to cloud Croft that weekend with a bunch of friends and reset. Grieved, paid my respects and came back an entirely new man. I was ready and excited to come back to my company. I was now deploying in 2 months, **July 15th.**

&amp;#x200B;

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

&amp;#x200B;

Rebirth of Bone Guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I started diving right back into this effort. Any time I went through a struggle this things was always there for me. I wanted to help others do more drives and spent my time getting ready for deployment and building up a team of volunteers across the Army.

&amp;#x200B;

**June 28th -** I met with Mario Terenas, the former 10th Mountain division CSM and now deputy chief of AUSA’s Center for Leadership. We were connected through the journalist for Army Magazine who had become a dear friend of mine. That call changed my entire perspective for this efforts possibility. It didn't just end at Bliss for me. It could and WILL be an Army wide program. He invited me to attend the AUSA national conference and made dozens of promises to introduce me to important leaders in the mean time. He asked for the products I had so he could show them off. I had none lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to decide. Do I deploy or pursue this opportunity. I joined the Army so I could see more of the world than my little ghetto I grew up in. This was my only chance. Everyone I knew was going. Or do I try and stay, make another sacrifice for the pipedream of chasing this. Could I really make an army wide program? I chose to roll the dice. I planned for weeks for this meeting. We went on spring block leave and I spent the entire time at my computer preparing. Networking, creating products, researching, and planning for one big power move. An open door with my brigade CSM to convince him that this is worth pursuing. Or maybe he will convince me it's not.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 1st -** [my Army magazine article comes out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14w32bi/im_in_the_army_magazine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

J**uly 6th -** I met with my CSM. 8 days from my flight date. His first day back from block leave. I had everything he could say and my perfect answer prewritten and memorized. I had a big SITREP typed up with a timeline plan blocked out for the rest of the year leading to the conference. I was ready. It was just supposed to be a brief about my efforts, but it quickly segued into “how would this deployment affect it.” “Greatly CSM” and 7 minutes later I was officially staying. He just had to figure out where. My MOS was being dropped from my brigade so I wasn't going to have a job either way.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 12th -** I met with CSM Light, the 1AD CSM for the first time. He read over my SITREP and plan, and listened carefully to everything I had to say. He told me my place was right here at division and he would have me moved shortly. He just didn't know where to fit me yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 15th -** My Flight date for my deployment passes me by. I remain right where I was at. Now Rear-D for 2nd BDE

&amp;#x200B;

I basically existed without a unit for the next month. I got my tonsils removed and spent all my week days with a self assigned 9-8 work schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

**August 7th -** the day I got my ability to speak back I began meeting with every unit in post and planning one of the largest bone marrow donor registry drives in Army history. Every unit in bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

**August 14-19th -** I got a detail of soldiers dedicated to helping me. [Went to 22 battalions over these 5 days running registry events. 2-5 a day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/15qxo61/the_fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_the_largest_donor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**August 22nd -** I started my first day at my new company. Running the orderly room for division.

&amp;#x200B;

[I went to the field, learned my job. Began working to fix the rosters for division while still networking and helping my team get events done and meetings done.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14xwg97/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_operation_ring_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**September -** Every waking moment of my life. 19 hours a day 7 days a week of dedicated to transforming this from a hobby to a full fledged program. Building a Google share drive that would allow every single person who wants to get involved to have premade tools, walkthroughs, presentations, resources, and guides for everything they could possibly need.

&amp;#x200B;

\-[We now accounted for 77% of all registrations in the Army for the year of 2023.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/16nxf24/last_year_fort_bliss_accounted_for_57_of_army/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

\-[I was spending every day getting absolutely everything perfect for the AUSA Conference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/171hyga/ama_operation_ring_the_bell_a_grass_roots/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)It was the biggest chance we'd ever get and we had to show up ready for absolutely anything because he had absolutely zero information.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 8th-12th -** [We went to the conference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18dw2am/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_how_a_bunch_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Met with almost every army leader imaginable. Pitching our program to every leader from the division level to the Chief of Staff. [Passing out a hundred one-page hitters and 65 wooden SPC coins that were my business cards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/175wjzy/i_spent_every_minute_of_the_army_national/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**October 13th -** [Attended the Army National Guard Commanders conference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/17cwsds/i_somehow_managed_to_convince_the_national_guard/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I gave a speech in front of every single national guard general alive and give the general my coin.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 14th -** Visited the Salute to Life Labs and learned everything about the process of extracting HLA typing from samples. Got every bit of mystery removed from the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Spent the weekend hanging out in DC with my best friend who drove up. One of the best Saturday club nights of my life lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 18th -** Flew back home and hours later went to the field.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 25th -** Debriefed the CSM and he decided he wanted me to do this full time. Moving me into the G6 section of division HQ.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 30th -** began working at G6 Help desk

&amp;#x200B;

\-Got a random phone call from the SMA office. Didn't know they were allowed to do that. The SMA wanted to follow up on my work, and wanted to know how he could help. Was told MEDCOM would be reaching out soon.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the month of November is me doing meetings, calls, scheduling trips and planning out the new year and it's trips and meetings.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 28th -** ArmyTimes article comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 1st -** Got moved to G6s VTC section because it lined up better with my work schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 2nd -** Got moved to the imaging room section because I don't know.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 4th -** MEDCOM called me.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 8th -** Got moved back to the Help desk because low staffing.

&amp;#x200B;

**December 3rd -** December 6th - [Took my first ever TDY for the program.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18a80a6/my_first_ever_tdy_for_the_bone_marrow_program_off/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Went to Fort Cavazos and met with 1st CAV, 1st MED BDE, III Corps. As well as did some events. [As well as drive around feeding soldiers.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18c1pms/i_went_to_the_1st_med_bde_summit_and_at_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**December 7th -** moved to the division surgeon cell to now fully run this program with guidance from staff officers. The first 25s to ever be attached to the surgeon cell. The first ever SPC to work in that office. Ever confused. I wasn't even a part of the conversation. Just got told the day I got back.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the month is just meetings meetings meetings I can't post about just yet. I don't like to post uncertainties or things in progress you know what i mean? ;)

&amp;#x200B;

This has been the absolute hardest year of my life. I cannot cope with the amount of loss and gain and growth and success and failures I've experienced in such a short time. This doesn't even cover all of it. I really cannot wrap my head around how much has happened in so little time. One year, and enough to fit a whole career. How do I fit all of this into my identity? How can I get any of the ego I have to have for what all is coming next when all of that success is marked by so much loss and failure and sacrifice to get there? I don't know. But I cannot bring into words how much this community means to me in its support and encouragement. So many times I've felt totally lost, and I could just dive back into this community and this work and find myself again.

&amp;#x200B;

Shoutouts to some of the realest Homies on the sub. There are a ton of people who I want to shout-out but these active users are such great parts of what makes this community so amazing to be a part of.

Another long post!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not a very holiday oriented person. I legitimately forget holidays are coming up and could not tell you the date of any holiday besides probably July 5th (Huehue). But there is one holiday I never forget, and it could maybe be because it&amp;#39;s literally impossible. Like you may forget how many inches are on a ruler, but you definitely know what number it starts with; 0. That&amp;#39;s New Years. I fucking love New Years, it a hard set date that marks time progressing forward. Each year is a race to try and do as much as possible before the end of that 20– number. It gets me in this weird philosophical mindset where I dread and embrace the passage of time. Something about changing the year I wrote by muscle memory all year as it was unchanging and concrete, the old one being one I will never write with the same mentality ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The year that was once the mark of cutting edge modernity,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“um It is literally 2023,  how are we still doing this, get with the times 💅”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Becomes old, dated, and represents some defining moment of that year we are now moving forward from, moving on. It&amp;#39;s now 2024 and we are barreling towards a new great defining moment that we can&amp;#39;t predict or plan for.  What&amp;#39;s going to be the Defining Moment for humanity? the moment for America? What&amp;#39;s going to be the Defining Moment for you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am still a baby faced innocent young man of 23, so years aren&amp;#39;t zooming by yet. These things take forever to pass. And I feel like I am a different person at the end of each one. But this year in particular has been the most unending, mindwarpingly, soul-testingly long 365 days of my life. I cannot put it in my head that so much happened in this year, it feels like 4. Every month I am a whole new person, and often at a whole new place in life it seems. I used to do posts here only after every significant developments and achievements happened, but it got to a point that if I kept that up, I&amp;#39;d be posting every week or twice a week and nobody wants that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both to help me get the story straight in my head and to send off the craziest year of my life, here&amp;#39;s a wrap up of my 2023. What&amp;#39;s yours?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE BEGINNING OF MY YEAR.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the most challenging and awful months of my life. I will explain it in extreme detail because it was incredibly difficult and I never posted openly about all of it. Covers me almost dying, me creating the first real army bone marrow program, me joining the boss executive council and getting fired from the executive council.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 1st -&lt;/strong&gt; Started my job with the Bliss BOSS executive council along with two others, we were all collectively going to fully replace the current council.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 15th&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/10ixiaa/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_22_yo_spc_currently/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I began a two week long marrow donor registry drive at WBAMC.&lt;/a&gt; Sourced soldiers to help from my brigade CSM who gave me 6 from different units each day. I did two shifts with 3 in the morning and three in the afternoon, 14 hours total each day. Each day I had to train, manage, and watch the team.  As well as source and ensure I had my team for the next day. I was walking well over 8 miles a day between all my tables and averaging 70+ calls a day managing the team, hospital staff, and sourcing, while also doing my job with BOSS remotely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 25th -&lt;/strong&gt; I did a local news interview, as well as an interview with Army Magazine. Right after I started feeling sick. Progressively getting worse until I had to spend the last 4 hours of the day passed out on a table in an empty conference room I had claimed as my HQ. That same week my &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/BlissBoneMarrowGuy/comments/10gnj08/task_and_purpose/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;taskandpurpose article&lt;/a&gt; came out finally. It was a big week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 26th -&lt;/strong&gt;  I woke up that morning ungodly sick, I absolutely could not speak.  I texted and told one of my trusted guys that he is going to have to handle today on his own. I wasn&amp;#39;t going to make it in. I texted my POC for the hospital, a MSG who reached out on Reddit and made the whole detail possible and let her know. She told me I was dumb if I did not go to the ER and get some meds. I was literally vomiting phlegm every couple minutes and had a 105 temperature and getting worse. I was completely delirious and managed to barely text one of my friends to take me to the E.R. Within an hour I was on a breathing tube and getting emergency surgery. I was just told they were removing my tonsils and draining the extreme swelling. It was so bad they had to put the tube in while I was awake, then immediately put me to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;January 30th -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/10qevmd/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_another_post_and/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I woke up in the ICU covered in tubes and bruises.&lt;/a&gt; I was told I had the worst case of a very rare case of tonsillitis called periodontal tonsillitis they&amp;#39;d ever seen. I would have died that day from my throat closing up had I not gone to the E.R. when I did. It took 6 people to hold me down to get the tube in and I almost bit through it, as well as the surgeon&amp;#39;s finger when he tried to pry my mouth open. They almost had to do a chest trach. They also had lost my phone in the struggle when it was launched across the room. Took two days for them to find it and my friends and partner having no clue what happened to me. I lost 17 pounds and had acquired some extreme body dysmorphia and muscle dystrophy. My number two guy who I had basically abandoned with only a “you gotta handle today” 5 days prior had continued on with running the hospital drive in my place with no further information from me or any clue what happened. He handled the final two days with no supply refills and no way to actually contact the next day&amp;#39;s detail members. But he did what he could. That drive registered 685 people and more than tripled the previous records for hospital registry drives in military history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 2nd -&lt;/strong&gt; I leave the hospital and have to go right back to work. Having learned while I was being recognized by the CG the next day, and going through every drug withdrawal on the planet at the time from what the hospital had me on. It was a rough day. Spent all night sick, achey, and with massive mood swings from the steroid shot withdrawals. Barely fell asleep 2 hours before my wake up time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 3rd -&lt;/strong&gt; Woke up early, got in trouble with the BOSS council for missing my up-text by 3 minutes. I had to make a huge power move today, I almost died and with that, all my efforts gone to nothing. Before today my work was only ever a hobby, with no real goal of where to go with it. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/12jtz4k/spc_awards_1st_armoured_divisions_2_star/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I spent 6 hours that morning typing up and designing a 37 page continuity book, finding a printer, binder, and page protector.

Basically every single commander and CSM on post gathers each month in one building.&lt;/a&gt; I was there to award them this huge sculpted wood femur bone trophy I had been making for almost a year for their (my) achievements for donations. I had gotten no further information from the CG so I had another power move ready to go. My killer right hand man from the hospital drive agreed to help me get ready. We assembled 5 more binders of continuity books and planned to hand them out in the wide open to every medical officer right in front of the division leadership. I expected nothing to come from this either. We were scrambling around trying to buy the stuff. I was at the PX frowning over binder prices and we was off at a print shop when I got a call from the division surgeon cell SGM. He told me they were tasked to work with me to create the OPORD for making my continuity book a full program across Fort Bliss. I dropped to the floor in the middle of the shoppette. We finished the books, awarded the trophy and went on with our day. Once I got in my car later to go get a beer and celebrate it all hit me, and I spent the entire drive and a long time in the parking lot screaming, punching the steering wheel and crying tears of joy for the first time in my life. It was all worth it. All my pain and losses and illness. Once I got my health back, I began obsessing over the gym and eating. Putting on 20 pounds in 3 weeks and eating over 4K calories a day to get back what I lost. I had bought dress pants, chinos and such, after I got out the hospital when I was still dilapidatley skinny for my job at BOSS and put so much muscle on my butt and thighs so quickly I popped the buttons off or tore the back pockets of every single pair of those pants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February - March -&lt;/strong&gt; I began building my OPORD for the program with the division surgeon. Pouring my self entirely into my job at BOSS. Obsessing over finding and networking businesses to work with us to have consistent and long term volunteer events with unique places of need within the city. Special needs schools, nursing homes, movie nights at homeless shelters, soul kitchens and pantrys, etc. as well as chess clubs around the city, D&amp;amp;D nights, horse riding, and other things. I wanted the soldiers who never leave the barracks to join events that fit their interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned excel and rebuilt &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13lb194/i_redesigned_the_fort_bliss_boss_programs_entire/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;the backend tracking system for BOSS&lt;/a&gt; to allow us to track which brigades are signing up for events and which are not, located and tied in every BOSS rep since the system was completely out of date, and developed ways to keep these reps accountable for ensuring soldiers know about our events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;March 16th -&lt;/strong&gt; had to get my left shoulder totally reconstructed. My arm and years old grappling injuries and new army injuries had caused it to start dislocating in my sleep. It dislocated around 23 times in the year since I had been at Bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;April -&lt;/strong&gt; recovery from surgery, personal losses. Personal Struggles and professional differences with the new president of BOSS. Feeling like it was time to let BoneMarrowGuy die since there was no further I could go. I was making a division wide permanent program and that&amp;#39;s as far as my potential to make a difference. Maybe other divisions will follow, maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the month I was facing down serious burnout from everything, those differences at work were so bad I was beginning to document every single things I did every day to the minute. Every conversation and task completed or progressed or failed. I couldn&amp;#39;t figure it out and just dived more into even more of a OCD routine to make it work. I was smoking a pack of black and mild&amp;#39;s and two beers a day as my only vice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 2nd -&lt;/strong&gt; I was facing down serious burnout, I was making plans to take advantage of a three day weekend to get a bunch of friends and get an AirBnb in the mountain forest two hours away and just take a rest. That day I had invited two great friends to join me and some others to come up. I hadn&amp;#39;t kept nearly as close as I should have with them but they told me they wanted to start hanging out again. Two roommates who were absolutely inseparable, literally together 24/7 or on the phone. That night I was at my partners house and got a call from my NCO asking if I was okay, because there were a bunch of MPs and an ambulance at the barracks. I figured another rowdy combat engineer night or someone burned a pizza again. Or maybe something else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 3rd -&lt;/strong&gt; At 1300 I got curious and called a friend of mine while at work. I casually asked “was it a suicide” he said yes and I asked with disconnected attention if he knew who. He said it was my friend, the one I had spoken to yesterday. I fuckin ran out of the office and immediately started calling trying to figure out where her friend was. I got a hold of their 1SG and was told she was in the hospital and would be back soon. I went to the store and bought every goddamn grocery, cooked days of meal prep and waited until I was told she got back and dropped it all off at her door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May 4th -&lt;/strong&gt; that night I stayed up all night with a SSG from my company talking to him about how to deal with it. I had a mason jar with the fanciest rum drink on the planet, chopped up fruit garnish everything. I finally went to bed at 4AM with it untouched next to me. Overslept by hours because my phone had died with my partner on the line. Woke up to a knock at my door, it was the BOSS president. I was fired an hour later by phone call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went up to cloud Croft that weekend with a bunch of friends and reset. Grieved, paid my respects and came back an entirely new man. I was ready and excited to come back to my company. I was now deploying in 2 months, &lt;strong&gt;July 15th.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rebirth of Bone Guy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started diving right back into this effort. Any time I went through a struggle this things was always there for me. I wanted to help others do more drives and spent my time getting ready for deployment and building up a team of volunteers across the Army.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 28th -&lt;/strong&gt; I met with Mario Terenas, the former 10th Mountain division CSM and now deputy chief of AUSA’s Center for Leadership. We were connected through the journalist for Army Magazine who had become a dear friend of mine. That call changed my entire perspective for this efforts possibility. It didn&amp;#39;t just end at Bliss for me. It could and WILL be an Army wide program. He invited me to attend the AUSA national conference and made dozens of promises to introduce me to important leaders in the mean time. He asked for the products I had so he could show them off. I had none lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to decide. Do I deploy or pursue this opportunity. I joined the Army so I could see more of the world than my little ghetto I grew up in. This was my only chance. Everyone I knew was going. Or do I try and stay, make another sacrifice for the pipedream of chasing this. Could I really make an army wide program? I chose to roll the dice. I planned for weeks for this meeting. We went on spring block leave and I spent the entire time at my computer preparing. Networking, creating products, researching, and planning for one big power move. An open door with my brigade CSM to convince him that this is worth pursuing. Or maybe he will convince me it&amp;#39;s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 1st -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14w32bi/im_in_the_army_magazine/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;my Army magazine article comes out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J&lt;strong&gt;uly 6th -&lt;/strong&gt; I met with my CSM. 8 days from my flight date. His first day back from block leave. I had everything he could say and my perfect answer prewritten and memorized. I had a big SITREP typed up with a timeline plan blocked out for the rest of the year leading to the conference. I was ready. It was just supposed to be a brief about my efforts, but it quickly segued into “how would this deployment affect it.” “Greatly CSM” and 7 minutes later I was officially staying. He just had to figure out where. My MOS was being dropped from my brigade so I wasn&amp;#39;t going to have a job either way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 12th -&lt;/strong&gt; I met with CSM Light, the 1AD CSM for the first time. He read over my SITREP and plan, and listened carefully to everything I had to say. He told me my place was right here at division and he would have me moved shortly. He just didn&amp;#39;t know where to fit me yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;July 15th -&lt;/strong&gt; My Flight date for my deployment passes me by. I remain right where I was at. Now Rear-D for 2nd BDE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I basically existed without a unit for the next month. I got my tonsils removed and spent all my week days with a self assigned 9-8 work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 7th -&lt;/strong&gt; the day I got my ability to speak back I began meeting with every unit in post and planning one of the largest bone marrow donor registry drives in Army history. Every unit in bliss.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 14-19th -&lt;/strong&gt; I got a detail of soldiers dedicated to helping me. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/15qxo61/the_fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_the_largest_donor/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Went to 22 battalions over these 5 days running registry events. 2-5 a day.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 22nd -&lt;/strong&gt; I started my first day at my new company. Running the orderly room for division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14xwg97/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_operation_ring_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I went to the field, learned my job. Began working to fix the rosters for division while still networking and helping my team get events done and meetings done.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;September -&lt;/strong&gt; Every waking moment of my life. 19 hours a day 7 days a week of dedicated to transforming this from a hobby to a full fledged program. Building a Google share drive that would allow every single person who wants to get involved to have premade tools, walkthroughs, presentations, resources, and guides for everything they could possibly need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/16nxf24/last_year_fort_bliss_accounted_for_57_of_army/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;We now accounted for 77% of all registrations in the Army for the year of 2023.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-&lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/171hyga/ama_operation_ring_the_bell_a_grass_roots/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;I was spending every day getting absolutely everything perfect for the AUSA Conference.&lt;/a&gt;It was the biggest chance we&amp;#39;d ever get and we had to show up ready for absolutely anything because he had absolutely zero information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 8th-12th -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18dw2am/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_how_a_bunch_of/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;We went to the conference.&lt;/a&gt; Met with almost every army leader imaginable. Pitching our program to every leader from the division level to the Chief of Staff. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/175wjzy/i_spent_every_minute_of_the_army_national/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Passing out a hundred one-page hitters and 65 wooden SPC coins that were my business cards.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 13th -&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/17cwsds/i_somehow_managed_to_convince_the_national_guard/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Attended the Army National Guard Commanders conference.&lt;/a&gt; I gave a speech in front of every single national guard general alive and give the general my coin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 14th -&lt;/strong&gt; Visited the Salute to Life Labs and learned everything about the process of extracting HLA typing from samples. Got every bit of mystery removed from the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spent the weekend hanging out in DC with my best friend who drove up. One of the best Saturday club nights of my life lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 18th -&lt;/strong&gt; Flew back home and hours later went to the field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 25th -&lt;/strong&gt; Debriefed the CSM and he decided he wanted me to do this full time. Moving me into the G6 section of division HQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;October 30th -&lt;/strong&gt; began working at G6 Help desk&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Got a random phone call from the SMA office. Didn&amp;#39;t know they were allowed to do that. The SMA wanted to follow up on my work, and wanted to know how he could help. Was told MEDCOM would be reaching out soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the month of November is me doing meetings, calls, scheduling trips and planning out the new year and it&amp;#39;s trips and meetings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 28th -&lt;/strong&gt; ArmyTimes article comes out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 1st -&lt;/strong&gt; Got moved to G6s VTC section because it lined up better with my work schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 2nd -&lt;/strong&gt; Got moved to the imaging room section because I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 4th -&lt;/strong&gt; MEDCOM called me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;November 8th -&lt;/strong&gt; Got moved back to the Help desk because low staffing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 3rd -&lt;/strong&gt; December 6th - &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18a80a6/my_first_ever_tdy_for_the_bone_marrow_program_off/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;Took my first ever TDY for the program.&lt;/a&gt; Went to Fort Cavazos and met with 1st CAV, 1st MED BDE, III Corps. As well as did some events. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18c1pms/i_went_to_the_1st_med_bde_summit_and_at_the/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3""&gt;As well as drive around feeding soldiers.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;December 7th -&lt;/strong&gt; moved to the division surgeon cell to now fully run this program with guidance from staff officers. The first 25s to ever be attached to the surgeon cell. The first ever SPC to work in that office. Ever confused. I wasn&amp;#39;t even a part of the conversation. Just got told the day I got back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the month is just meetings meetings meetings I can&amp;#39;t post about just yet. I don&amp;#39;t like to post uncertainties or things in progress you know what i mean? ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has been the absolute hardest year of my life. I cannot cope with the amount of loss and gain and growth and success and failures I&amp;#39;ve experienced in such a short time. This doesn&amp;#39;t even cover all of it. I really cannot wrap my head around how much has happened in so little time. One year, and enough to fit a whole career. How do I fit all of this into my identity? How can I get any of the ego I have to have for what all is coming next when all of that success is marked by so much loss and failure and sacrifice to get there? I don&amp;#39;t know. But I cannot bring into words how much this community means to me in its support and encouragement. So many times I&amp;#39;ve felt totally lost, and I could just dive back into this community and this work and find myself again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shoutouts to some of the realest Homies on the sub. There are a ton of people who I want to shout-out but these active users are such great parts of what makes this community so amazing to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I’m a 21 year old dude and I’ve been strongly considering enlisting. 

As a general background I’ll be starting my last semester of college soon, and after that will be graduating with a degree in Sport Management. 

For a variety of reasons I feel like I chose the wrong degree. However my mistake has left me with 25k in debt. My plan prior to considering enlisting (a recent idea) was to move back home with my parents and work off my debt until I can become financially independent. 

But now at 21, I want to get out of the house and get on with life. However I will soon have a degree I don’t want that only affords me jobs I don’t want to work. My home environment is terrific and I have wonderful parents, but I feel “trapped” due to my situation and don’t see how I’m going to get out. The other issue is I don’t know what I want and feel like I lack purpose 

For this reason I see three options:

1- apply and look for jobs using this degree that I don’t want, work said job long enough to get out of the house, and get rid of my debt then decide what to do

2- go to grad school, take on more debt, use the advanced degree to get a job closer to what I want (which I don’t know). This decision I feel like is going to leave me in the same situation as I am now but just delay it by a few years

3- Enlist. Live as cost minimum as possible, serve my country (fulfilling the need for a purpose), pay off debt, open job opportunities within the service

,Army,I have a friend/coworker who wants to join the army super bad. She’s 23. In good shape. Scored a 99 on her asvab. But she’s got a MH history from when she was 12.

They keep requiring more paperwork. The army has dragged their feet for so long that the paperwork she originally submitted has expired or timed out and she has to resubmit all new paperwork. As I said I’m just some dumb civilian. But w the recruiting crisis we have and the numbers being so low. I work on post. I see the trainees that come in between basic and AIT.

TikTok is full of videos of kids bashing the army (again in uniform) selfies indoors wearing pc’s flipping off ds’s behind thier backs. Like these kids are trash.

,Army,"My recruiter wants to send in false documents. I have a high school diploma, but since i went to several different high schools, the recruiter wants to make a fake one saying i attended a high school i never went to. He says its not going to get me in trouble, but I'm starting to think this recruiter is trying to fuck me over. As stated before, I graduated high school with a diploma. The recruiter wants to make a fake one. I'm not sure what to do. I just took the ASVAB, and scored a 124 GT. I'm just scared it'll fuck me over during security clearance, or the SF pipeline.

Edit: I appreciate all of you guys responding so timely. This whole situation seemed sketchy, and a lot of your answers assisted me in realizing I was about to get fucked over super hard. I chose a recruiter in a neighboring County, as he is a buddy of a buddy.

The recruiter wants to make a fake one. I&amp;#39;m not sure what to do. I just took the ASVAB, and scored a 124 GT.

,Army,"Trying to become an officer at almost 35

Hi everyone. I am a male, 34 years old; I'll be turning 35 in a couple of months. I've had some familiarity with the military since an early age. My stepdad retired from the US Army as an E-8 in aviation. While we lived in the States, I was forced to join the JROTC (to gain some discipline at the time). I did it for a year, and after we moved abroad. I've been moving from place to place since then. I am looking at going back to the States and settling.

I hold a US Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Psychology. And I have two Master's, both from a Spanish university online. One is in Education, and the other one in UX-Design. My GPA in all my degrees ranges from 2.4-2.8.

My career has developed mostly in language teaching. I am considering the option of becoming an officer either in the US Army or USAF. In the Army, I am a good fit for a Human Resources Officer, and in the USAF, I could potentially be an Intel Officer ( I did not find an HR officer on their website.

I am currently abroad, so I can't visit a recruiter. I am physically able to score 100 on the PT in both branches; however, I am approximately 30lb overweight for my age group. I'm 5'10'' with 220lb.

Also, I don't have any tattoos; however, I have a couple on my bucket list, and I might get them this year.

I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this goal.

,Army,"Hello,
Not sure if this topic falls under here, it’s my first time posting on Reddit.

  I’ve been enlisted in the Army for almost 2 years now and I’ve been actively thinking about quitting. 
It’s not that I’m in a shitty unit or that my NCOs treat me horribly, I have a medical condition that makes me non deployable (I can’t attend training in order to make me deployable) and I’m looking forward to a life of gate guard and arms room. It’s terribly frustrating because I was looking forward to the opportunities I’ll get, but got my physicals back just to be disappointed. I believe it would get better with time (maybe), but the way everyone else is treating my non deployable status makes me want to quit and discourages me to go on. The thing is if I got stationed in a unit that doesn’t require any previous training in order to deploy it wouldn’t have mattered, but since this unit needs this class, now I’m just a shit bag getting all the jobs that nobody wants.

  Another reason I want out is that my fiancé is stationed far from me and simply is hard to balance plane tickets and bills to see each other often. We have been considering the fact I get moved to a unit at their station after getting married, but from what I’ve heard it’s a gamble since we’re both active. 

  I wanted to propose the fact that I have no use in this unit if I can’t deploy (since this unit is on a constant rotation) and if they could somehow move me if we get married, but I’m not sure how this process works or if I would fall in my favor. 
Between balancing my health, mental health, and anxiety it has been rough past 6 months and started my new years depressed. 

The best result would be moving to a unit at my fiancé’s station and living together and staying in the army till my contract is up, but if that’s not possible I want out. 

  My room mate had thrown out the suggestion of failing ACFT, but I feel like that wouldn’t work so well. My other friend suggested going to BH again and explain everything I’ve been going through and get separation papers that way, but I don’t know if my reasons would be valid enough for that.
I’m not exactly sure what I’m trying to ask, but I’m just burned out and want to be with someone that wants to be with me and needs me. Is failing PT test or BH really the method to go? Would getting married warrant me a change of duty stations? I know there’s no way of avoiding hate and shitty jokes about how I’m trash and a quitter but at this point no matter what I do I’m no use to the unit and am trash anyways. I just want to know how the process would look like.

,Army,"Have you checked the HRC trends report for your MOS?  HRC periodically issues statistics not simply on the promotion point cut-off score for each MOS for promotion to SGT and SSG, but also publishes a look at the distribution of eligible soldiers by their current promotion points.  The attached chart is created from one of these HRC reports: SSG\_SGT-Eligibles-Trend-Report with the most recent being dated 4 DEC 2023.

In the chart, ranges of promotion points are shown on the horizontal axis (e.g. 24-49 points).  The bars represent a count of the SSG eligible soldiers and show the actual number above the bar.

If you are working towards promotion, this will give a clearer sense of where you stand relative to others in your MOS on promotion points.  Then you can strategize on ways to strengthen your position or to coach your soldiers.

As context using 11B, the SSG promo points cut-off for Oct, Nov, and Dec was 360, 357, and 396 points, respectively.  Also, in Dec 2023, there are 1220 SSG eligibles developing and moving towards promotion.  The average point score is 287 and average cut-off score over recent months is 365.

How does the distribution strike you?

Can I get Ranger School after OSUT?

Hello, I am currently enlisting in the army national guard as an 11b. I’m curious if I could get ranger school after osut. I saw that one of the newer recruits got it and he went to ranger school, air assault school and airborne school straight after osut.

Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.

Background, i’m 16, in highschool, and i’ve been very interested in the service my whole life. I’m not bad at school, my grades are very good and i’m in all advance classes. I’m considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i’ve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don’t know much, pretty little actually and I’m planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!

Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.

I'm about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I'm looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I'll be recycled if I don't meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don't pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won't kick me out, right?

I'll continue pushing. I don't know how long it takes, but I just worry they'll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn't care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.

Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn't qualified due to weight)

It's no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I've seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created. Give the Shadow guys a place to discuss the future of the MOS along with advice on what to do going forward.

Also, any advice on being reclassed? How the process starts and about how many offerings they give? Asking for a friend...

I’m 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I’ll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I’m mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I’ll regret it from what I hear from videos I’ve watched. I’ve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS’s I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS’s do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!

(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don’t have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.

My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y’all. the recruiter has said I won’t be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn’t need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn’t get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn’t get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying “you CAN get an option 4”, then immediately someone else is telling me “You CANT get an option 4” As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don’t “get a number” whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.

Should recruiters let you know when they’re on leave? I’ve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they’ll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it’s submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he’s been on leave for a little over a week. I didn’t know, he just disappeared and they’ve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.

Shipping FEB 5th to OSUT then Off to Germany as a 19D... ONLY option 19 to germany in my contract... Question is :   ""COULD"" I volunteer and get airborne during OSUT and potentially go 1-91 with the 173rd? or am I most likely going to 2CR  with no chance at an European Airborne unit?

I went to meps about a year ago and failed the hearing test twice, submitted a waiver and got denied. I was told I can go back to meps and try again and plan on going within the next month.

Has anybody had any experiences like this and gotten accepted to enlist? Any tips on what I can do to improve my chances of passing, or advice in general would be appreciated.

Been thinking about reclassing. I remember when I went through my MOS school the first time (AIT), that you could speed up the process and just take the test for that particular class week, and passing it would advance your progress. I don't remember what it was called. Can anyone help so I can look up the details?

What is AIT like?

I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS's at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. 

Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? 

What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I'm in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?

Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?

How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn't within walking distance?

I have a ton of questions, but I can't think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.

Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.

1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?

There's a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I'm in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.

I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.

2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?

Jobs

Prior service here, looking to go back into my original MOSs but it’s under precision retention so idk how that’s gonna go. 

My grade determination came back and it said I have to choose from 35F, 35G, 35P, 35T, and 88H to keep my grade. 

Anyone know how life is in those MOSs? What’s the day to day job like? What type of units would I be in?Trying to figure out what I should choose as a back up option.

Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 🤦‍♂️They didn’t clean my ears so I assume they didn’t see a reason to. From what I know, I don’t have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can’t tell you the exact scores because I don’t remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I’m not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.

I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m

I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can't. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.

I’m 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don’t have to, but I have to live with her and she’s my legal guardian, and she’s a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren’t getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I’m going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don’t know about the “permanentness” (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she’ll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I’m trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I’m walking into tommorow and Thursday.  
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)

I am joining Army Reserve - 27d (not official  yet still have to go through MEPS). Hoping yall could help me out with some questions. 

•recruiter mentioned I may be able to skip some AIT because my civilian job is closely related. I haven’t been able to find out much about this. I’m not sure if I should do that or just go get the actual army training. Anyone have any advice? 
• I want to deploy (hopefully to some place interesting) sooner rather than later. How much of a say do I get as a reserve member about timeline and location? Could there be any chance of coming back from training and leaving within a month or so?

Hi everyone, 

I'm about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I'm currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don't want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. 

For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. 

Thanks in advance.

Did I do the MEPS hearing test wrong twice?

I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it’s performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row? I need to know if I failed due to my own negligence or because I genuinely have hearing issues.

Hello everyone,

This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I’m 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.

I’m a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS’s I was offered either 13B or 19K. I’d like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I’m stupid but I’m interested in both MOS’s. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I’d have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m being very indecisive.

What are the Female Physical Requirements?

I’m enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don’t necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as “rucking”, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I’m new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.

&lt;p&gt;Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background, i’m 16, in highschool, and i’ve been very interested in the service my whole life. I’m not bad at school, my grades are very good and i’m in all advance classes. I’m considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i’ve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don’t know much, pretty little actually and I’m planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the deal w/ challenge coins? I see it spread to civ jobs too, with those coins to commemorate some event. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just my nomadic situation talking with little space to spare but I&amp;#39;d rather have something I can use, even a tshirt lol, than something that won&amp;#39;t have any use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I&amp;#39;m looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I&amp;#39;ll be recycled if I don&amp;#39;t meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don&amp;#39;t pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won&amp;#39;t kick me out, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll continue pushing. I don&amp;#39;t know how long it takes, but I just worry they&amp;#39;ll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn&amp;#39;t care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn&amp;#39;t qualified due to weight)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I&amp;#39;ve seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created.

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever got or heard of getting a medical waiver for a past shoulder dislocation (mine was in 2017) get approved? Like how lenient is the army on approving that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been out almost two years in March. Thinking of reenlisting. Would I have to go back to BCT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I’ll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I’m mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I’ll regret it from what I hear from videos I’ve watched. I’ve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS’s I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS’s do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m new to the Reddit community. I tried to post earlier but it wasn’t approved. I don’t understand why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is on antidepressants right now, can they join the army?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone had a minor fracture(not a break) in their hand in the last 4 years, without needing a cast or anything, will they be disqualified joining the army?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scored 90 on asvab and my recruiter and family saying not go to infantry. My recruiter trying to push nurse but I’m not joining the army to be a fucking nurse. 5,10 155 pretty fit. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kd21ald/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don’t have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y’all. the recruiter has said I won’t be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn’t need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn’t get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn’t get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying “you CAN get an option 4”, then immediately someone else is telling me “You CANT get an option 4” As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don’t “get a number” whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family is putting together a shadowbox to commemorate my dad&amp;#39;s service, and we were struggling to find what a specific unit pact should look like. Are there any dedicated resources that might provide pictures of what to look for and from what years? We are trying to find what the exact patch he would have had being part of JCSE at MacDill in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should recruiters let you know when they’re on leave? I’ve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they’ll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it’s submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he’s been on leave for a little over a week. I didn’t know, he just disappeared and they’ve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping FEB 5th to OSUT then Off to Germany as a 19D... ONLY option 19 to germany in my contract... Question is :   &amp;quot;COULD&amp;quot; I volunteer and get airborne during OSUT and potentially go 1-91 with the 173rd? or am I most likely going to 2CR  with no chance at an European Airborne unit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been thinking about reclassing. I remember when I went through my MOS school the first time (AIT), that you could speed up the process and just take the test for that particular class week, and passing it would advance your progress. I don&amp;#39;t remember what it was called. Can anyone help so I can look up the details?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can i go to MEPS and not sign a contract? my recruiter is telling me that i’ll go to meps for a physical and ASVAB, then come back and wait for an opening and i can sign the enlistment papers whenever i want&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is AIT like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS&amp;#39;s at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I&amp;#39;m in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn&amp;#39;t within walking distance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a ton of questions, but I can&amp;#39;t think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I&amp;#39;m in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kdkxgmn/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 🤦‍♂️They didn’t clean my ears so I assume they didn’t see a reason to. From what I know, I don’t have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can’t tell you the exact scores because I don’t remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I’m not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a criminal history with no charges and some hand tattoos how likely is it to get multiple waivers approved as 32 yr old male? just began talking with a recruiter today and he said he did not want to give me false hope but he would be talking to his boss and be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can&amp;#39;t. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don’t have to, but I have to live with her and she’s my legal guardian, and she’s a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren’t getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I’m going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don’t know about the “permanentness” (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she’ll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I’m trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I’m walking into tommorow and Thursday.&lt;br/&gt;
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I&amp;#39;m currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don&amp;#39;t want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I do the MEPS hearing test wrong twice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it’s performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row? I need to know if I failed due to my own negligence or because I genuinely have hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I’m 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a buddy who’s looking to join with me. He’s just worried about his genital psoriasis. He said it doesn’t bother him at all and it’s just a few red marks. He was never diagnosed by a doctor for it but he’s worried when he would go through MEPs a doctor would see it and disqualify him. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently a dep for 17E which I will be shipping out in sep of 2024 but as im looking more into 35t I feel like this mos could provide me with better opportunities after my contract. Any input on which mos would be better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kf6c8xf/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS’s I was offered either 13B or 19K. I’d like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I’m stupid but I’m interested in both MOS’s. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I’d have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m being very indecisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the Female Physical Requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don’t necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as “rucking”, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp;amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I’m new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So to start off with some background, I’m a 15W that is waiting to start class so that I can become MOS-Q (Qualified) and head to my first duty station. When I was researching Aviation jobs that related to operating drones, I did not find much info on the different MOSs and their job descriptions. So I thought I’d share some with others now that I know. 

The drone you will be operating is called the RQ-7 Shadow. From my understanding, our classroom cirriculum mainly includes memorizing different emergency procedures, then just getting familiar with the operation platform and how to read the information on the screen.


In regards to the barracks life, everyone wakes up for PT at 0400, then we march to the DFAC around 0600. From there, if you are a hold (not in class) you walk back to the barracks in battle buddy pairs and have around 3 hours to be productive (nap) or exercise at the nearby gym. Our Company is made up of around 150 students all of which are 15W, 15E, 15C or 15M.


We have 3 formations during the weekday. All of which are for attendance purposes and to make sure no one is dead in a ditch somewhere. As for the busywork, depending on how the company “behaves” it’s between, picking weeds, cleaning vacant rooms on the empty floors of the barracks, or random field training (rarely) like LandNav or voluntary Ruck Marches which you can earn lots of promotion points for participating in.


Weekend/Holiday privileges are based on your phase status. Everyone (besides MOS-Ts) begins as Phase IV and is able to apply for phase up testing after 3 weeks upon arrival. As Phase V you are able to go 30 miles off post, can skip certain accountability formations and as a result have about 9 uninterrupted hours of the day to yourself 0900-1800. As Phase V+ (Final phase) You are able to store and consume food in your room as well as go 100 miles off post on weekends. During the weekday you have the option to skip chow formations and not march down to the DFAC with the rest of the company. Battle buddies are required when going anywhere outside the company area.

I had no choice but to get out of the army, move across country &amp;amp; support my family. I lost my job (obviously) &amp;amp; had to stay home taking care of my family members. During my short, barely 3 years, in. I never went to sick call. Never complained. Sucked it up &amp;amp; pushed through. But when it came time for VA claims I was honest about the few issues I had here and there. I anticipated 30% TOPS for disability. I recently heard back that I was awarded 100% P&amp;amp;T disability, with nearly 40k in back pay. My son gets free private school &amp;amp; college, my student loans are paid off, &amp;amp; I have an income to support my family with, 4k a month from now until I croak. Posting out of disbelief &amp;amp; I guess as encouragement to those who are getting out soon. The army really does take care of it’s soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;

I honestly dont wanna fly without him and i wanna have all my animals there at once which means because of the airline restrictions that only two animals are allowed per person. 

im sorry if i wrote absolute nonsense lo but so far noone is able to give us some kind of answer.

,Army,"Ok, so bear with me here. 

I’m conflicted because I have a couple of options that I’m weighing out but I ultimately want to go Civil Affairs. I have the option to do SMP Cadet (something like ROTC) and essentially sign with an MOS (68W), finish up my school after about 3yrs but with this route, it requires that I commission as an officer upon graduation (complete either 8 years reserve upon graduation or compete for Active Duty [4yrs]), and as far as going CA I’m aware that I’d be looking at around another 3-4 more years before I’d even be able to put in a packet for a CA Officer. 

OR

I can directly enlist as a 38B in the Reserves and wait some time (say 2-3 years) and then try to go Active Duty and attend CAAS. During this time in the reserves I’d also like to finish my school in person (if possible), I’m guessing this way I won’t have to go the Officer route.

Also, how long would it take me to reach the required rank of SPC in the reserves component?

OR

I’ve thought about the prospect of enlisting Active Duty as a 35P (which I’m aware I’d have to go 35W), gaining valuable language skills and then putting a packet in for Civil Affairs when I reach the required rank (not sure on the timeframe). 

Any guidance or suggestions are appreciated. Which of these makes more sense?

Well it made me relic on my first duty station, showing up to 2CR as an 18 year old 11b in December 2011. 

The details are all important because I had A. No experience in the world, and now I’m suddenly in Europe with an old Samsung phone that slid up for a keyboard and a laptop with a US outlet. The phone was basically dead but before it died never fixed the time and I didn’t have anyone to ask the time. I show up to the unit, get yelled at for about an hour and get picked up by some SSG who tells me I’ll be in the scout platoon, however, I hadn’t tried out for it so it fuckin sucks to be me. Also - in December, if you didn’t know gets dark AF early in the afternoon in Germany. Didn’t know that either.

The SSG takes me to the PX to get some blankets and whatnot, I think we discussed timezone differences but again my phone was done for and nobody including him told me about the outlet situation and I hadn’t been to the barracks yet. We get to the barracks and everyone has a roommate who sleeps in the same room with them, except for me. There is nobody there to give me a heads up on anything. Ole NCO tells me to be at PT at 5:45 in ACUs so I can do in processing at 0800 (😑). I tell him I don’t have an alarm and all he told me is CQ will wake me up at 5:30. After this I walk across the hall and knock someone’s door and ask if I could borrow Wi-Fi for the night to know what time it is and the dude tells me no cause he doesn’t want my porn lagging his Xbox and slammed the door in my face (didn’t matter I didn’t have a plug for my phone or laptop anyway)

Next morning I wake up to absolute beatings on my door by a ton of specialists who had just got back from Afghanistan FREAKING OUT at me because it was 0600 and I hadn’t shown up yet. Once I’m fandangled into uniform I ask the CQ if they ever knocked on my door and these dudes just chuckle and go back to doing nothing. I show up to my platoon area where my acting PSG (who I don’t know and is in PTs) is going OFF on me about how every infantryman should have an internal clock and know what time it is at all portions of the day.

Seeking anyone’s experience with attending the National Intelligence University’s part time or monthly Masters of Science in Strategic Intelligence program. Also curious about anyone’s experience with their graduate certificate programs.

Previous posts have provided some details but I’m curious about:

- how difficult it was to balance the curriculum with work while maintaining a personal life

- Is all your work conducted in a SCIF or are you able to complete some readings and assignments from home? Is it logistically challenging to conduct thesis research?

- how does the monthly program work? Classes all day during a weekend and then you spend the time between weekends doing assignments/research?

- was the experience and education worth the time? Can you leverage the degree for post-army employment?

,Army,"If you haven’t heard, you no longer go to “My Absences” in IPPS-A to request leave. You go to “PAID” (Pay-Absences-Incent-Ded) to do that now. In some ways, the update actually seems better than the old system. But there’s a big flaw: you can no longer edit or delete any requests after you’ve submitted them. Here’s why that really sucks. 

My child was born last Thursday, so now I’ve gotta go in and request paternity leave so I can be home to help the wife out and be with my family. I unfortunately wasn’t able to get on IPPS-A on my phone or my computer on the hospital wifi (and there was no phone carrier service) and my wife and child weren’t discharged until Saturday. So we get home, I make a request, and go on with my day. Later on, I realize that I chose “birth of child” and not “non-birth parent” when requesting, which means I have to go in and change that. This is when I discovered that you can’t edit or delete requests anymore. Only the commander (hopefully) can. So I make a second request and explain the situation in the comments section of my new request. No big deal. 

Except now I realize that I’ve been requesting my leave to start on 03Jan, right after the 4-day. Uh-oh, I can’t do that, since the commander isn’t going to even see that request until 03Jan when we all return to work. I still have to report for duty that day since leave requested is not the same as leave approved. Realizing this, I go in to “edit” my request yet again, now for the third time. In comes our second major flaw in PAID. Since all three of my paternity leave requests would now exceed 84 days combined (84 is the max paternity leave dates allowed per birth/adoption/foster), my third request is not valid for submission. Now I get to email my commander explaining the whole situation and I feel like a tool for making all these mistakes back to back, but that’s what happens when your newborn destroys your sleep schedule. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever see the day when the military doesn’t give a contract to the lowest bidder, but it would be nice if we had a centralized system that wasn’t constantly full of coding errors.

So we get home, I make a request, and go on with my day. Later on, I realize that I chose “birth of child” and not “non-birth parent” when requesting, which means I have to go in and change that. This is when I discovered that you can’t edit or delete requests anymore. Only the commander (hopefully) can. So I make a second request and explain the situation in the comments section of my new request. No big deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except now I realize that I’ve been requesting my leave to start on 03Jan, right after the 4-day. Uh-oh, I can’t do that, since the commander isn’t going to even see that request until 03Jan when we all return to work. I still have to report for duty that day since leave requested is not the same as leave approved. Realizing this, I go in to “edit” my request yet again, now for the third time. In comes our second major flaw in PAID. Since all three of my paternity leave requests would now exceed 84 days combined (84 is the max paternity leave dates allowed per birth/adoption/foster), my third request is not valid for submission. Now I get to email my commander explaining the whole situation and I feel like a tool for making all these mistakes back to back, but that’s what happens when your newborn destroys your sleep schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if I’ll ever see the day when the military doesn’t give a contract to the lowest bidder, but it would be nice if we had a centralized system that wasn’t constantly full of coding errors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll take a medium fry and a chocolate frosty to dip them in.&lt;/p&gt;

So I already made a post in another Reddit thread, but I’ve been having some issues like projectile vomiting, diarrhea, and discovered a hammerhoids lump.

I’m in extreme pain - recruiter says I should suck it up and deal with it in reception, but will they tho? I can’t eat anything without vomiting or having bad diarrhea.

,Army,"I'm at my first assignment where we have a heavy GS Employee presence within our organizations. Looking for advice on dealing with a shitty GS employee that's causing my team and supervisors headaches.

We had a really good GS Staff primary retire. His replacement, is not good. The guy is suave, charismatic, confident, and appears technically confident. Meanwhile, this hiree has no work ethic and continues to gets my team, who serves in the higher HQs, in trouble constantly. We've been tasked multiple times for either myself or my team to go down to his location to ""Catch him up on work"" for a recorded period of 54 calendar days and counting. 

Analyzing our help desk tickets for example, in the month of November, we had 271 help desk tickets come into our shop. 176 of those tickets came from his organization, or 65% for that months tickets. Out of those 176 tickets, 148 tickets or 84% of those tickets, were account activation and cell phone tickets. Out of my other organizations? They had requested for support for issues they couldn't do at their level, but overall, zero tickets for account activations and cell phone activations were sent by those six other organizations. The data for the other months more/less looks the same.

During one of our forced visits by my chain-of-command, our NCO discovered the new hire was committing time card fraud (unauthorized vacation), was late to work every day, and leaves early daily. I informed the person's leadership, who told to me to ""mind my own business"". HR was worthless too. They threw up their hands, told me that if the COC doesn't want to do anything about it, then they can't touch it. My leadership got scared, told me that time card fraud is a big deal, and left it alone. I tried IG and IG directed me back to HR, whose not doing anything about it.

The guy's actions are starting to impact my team's morale. We keep having to provide soldiers to ""catch him up"". My leadership is apathetic and doesn't see anything wrong with helping the guy out. Just recently, he got my XO in trouble at a meeting for failing to do a high visibility task. Everyone who has to work with this guy continues to complain, but it falls on deaf ears. The response continues to be, ""Do the job for the guy"". We are now at the point now where I can't go half a day without some sort of problem happening at his level that only my team can solve or do.

,Army,"Throw away account for obvious reasons..

I’m a 36 year old army wife and I have been married to my husband (33), for 2 years. In the last two years he’s been abusing steroids and me. When he’s not roid raging he’s a great guy. However now, he’s taking heavy Russian steroids and injecting a great amount every single day for weeks with no breaks.

We have a one year old daughter and I  am not currently working or have access to money as he has complete control. I can make a plan to leave but it won’t be easy and will take time to make it happen. 

I understand if we spilt hell still have legal rights to see my daughter and I don’t want her stuck alone with steroid freak as he can’t control his violence in front of her. 


I truly want him to get help and get off steroids since I can leave him but my daughter will still have to see him. He’s been on them 17 years straight no breaks other than for basic training. 

He always had a bad temper but who he’s become now with this insane dose he’s taking is absolutely terrifying. If I leave him while he’s still on them I’m scared he’ll come kill me. 

If I tell his command would he get kicked out or would they get him the help? 

I don’t want him kicked out because he’s the father of my child and he needs the job as he wasn’t successful doing anything else. 


But if I leave him before he gets help I’m scared he will come kill me or hurt me. I currently have so many random bruises from his freak outs. 

He said he wouldn’t get off steroids for any reason no matter what.

,Army,"Look, this isn’t easy for either of us. I recognize that now. But we can’t keep meeting like this, it’s just getting upsetting. 

I thought I made it clear almost a year ago. I tried to let you down easy, I really did. I felt like just saying “it’s not you, it’s me” and letting you go your own way would be fine. I thought you didn’t care anyways. But here we are. You keep texting, and calling, and even fucking emailing me. How the hell did you get my new email anyway? I don’t have your name in it anymore…

But fine, I’ll be frank. When we started, I truly loved you. Not like I had a choice really. In some weird oedipal complex you were all I knew, but I was never more proud than the day I was yours. We wore matching clothes. You and I said it would be forever. We had so much fun together through the years. God you could be so sexy…

I really saw myself growing old with you, which made what came next all the more painful

Because down the line, and I won’t name specifics because I don’t think it would even matter, I began to realize I was nothing to you, and nobody meant anything to you in general. I saw you use people up and spit them out. I saw you lie, cheat, and steal. I saw sides of you I thought I could get past; but I couldn’t. Then you fucked me over. Multiple times.

I recognize that now. But we can’t keep meeting like this, it’s just getting upsetting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I made it clear almost a year ago. I tried to let you down easy, I really did. I felt like just saying “it’s not you, it’s me” and letting you go your own way would be fine. I thought you didn’t care anyways. But here we are. You keep texting, and calling, and even fucking emailing me. How the hell did you get my new email anyway? I don’t have your name in it anymore…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But fine, I’ll be frank. When we started, I truly loved you. Not like I had a choice really. In some weird oedipal complex you were all I knew, but I was never more proud than the day I was yours. We wore matching clothes. You and I said it would be forever. We had so much fun together through the years. God you could be so sexy…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really saw myself growing old with you, which made what came next all the more painful&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because down the line, and I won’t name specifics because I don’t think it would even matter, I began to realize I was nothing to you, and nobody meant anything to you in general. I saw you use people up and spit them out. I saw you lie, cheat, and steal. I saw sides of you I thought I could get past; but I couldn’t. Then you fucked me over. Multiple times. Despite my willing devotion. I grew up that day maybe, or perhaps I was just finally honest with myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t love you anymore. I don’t love you anymore. I will never be with you again. We are through. I am sorry, but also not really. &lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Lately, I have seen so many ""I want out"" or ""this shit sucks"" type posts and I just want to offer a bit of perspective.  

I have been in the Army for 24 years and I plan on retiring just shy of 26.  I have been AD enlisted, NG enlisted, and currently, I am an AD officer.  I've deployed three times to Afghanistan and I've PCS'd nine times, for context.  

My first duty station was Ft. Hood, pre-9/11.  This was well before smartphones and wifi became ubiquitous.  I thought my unit was pretty good, I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun - even when it sucked.  Camaraderie was pretty high.  

From Hood, I went to Germany.  Germany was an absolute blast and I had an amazing three years there.  I absolutely hated my unit in Germany and my leadership.  I dreaded every day and only looked forward to the weekend.  I legit had a thought one day that if I could only break my arm, I'd not have to go to work today.  That's how much I hated going.  But I loved Germany, so it balanced in a way.  As much as it sucked at times, I never contemplated failing PT, HT/WT, or something else more drastic to simply get out.  I know a lot of you may feel like you need to consider these, but I implore you not to cut off your nose to spite your face - as the adage goes.  I joined for a shot at a better life, consider why you joined before you get drastic and while it may not register now - you may look back in 10 years and wish you stayed the course.  

I ETS'd from Germany and was heading to college to do ROTC.  I really disliked my unit and most of the leadership, but I also realized that whole grass is greener adage.  Overall, the Army was good to me.  I had one great unit and one bad unit, so I was 50/50.  Plus, college was always a goal of mine since I grew up poor and the Army was the only way I was going to get a college education.  That, and I was ETSing and heading to college at the time my HS friends were just graduating college, had debt, and didn't make much money.  I thought real hard about just doing school and remaining a civilian, but the Army itself, the pension, and a few other factors tipped me towards the Army as a career.   

In the end, going back to the Army as an O was a no-brainer - for me.  But for you, again, consider why you joined.   A great NCO once told me to never base your feelings about the Army on one duty station alone.  I don't know if this is still a thing - but how I got to Germany from Hood was by submitting a 4187 for re-assignment.  You used to be able to do this once you hit 12 months on station.  I'm not saying this will work for you, but it may be something to look into if you're not currently happy in your current unit.  

The Army has changed a bit in 24 years.  Society has changed a bit too.  The Army has some pervasive issues to work through as well.  But please, I implore you, do not resort to drastic measures simply to get out.  You truly never do know what unintended consequences those actions may have.  Take care of your health, both mental and physical, and even if the Army isn't fully for you - use this time to plan (and save money) for what you want your life to look like post-Army.

&lt;p&gt;The Army has changed a bit in 24 years.  Society has changed a bit too.  The Army has some pervasive issues to work through as well.  But please, I implore you, do not resort to drastic measures simply to get out.  You truly never do know what unintended consequences those actions may have.  Take care of your health, both mental and physical, and even if the Army isn&amp;#39;t fully for you - use this time to plan (and save money) for what you want your life to look like post-Army.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;January is world carnivore month so I&amp;#39;ll take a Ribeye, med-rare, and a water.  &lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Trying to become an officer at almost 35

Hi everyone. I am a male, 34 years old; I'll be turning 35 in a couple of months. I've had some familiarity with the military since an early age. My stepdad retired from the US Army as an E-8 in aviation. While we lived in the States, I was forced to join the JROTC (to gain some discipline at the time). I did it for a year, and after we moved abroad. I've been moving from place to place since then. I am looking at going back to the States and settling.

I hold a US Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Psychology. And I have two Master's, both from a Spanish university online. One is in Education, and the other one in UX-Design. My GPA in all my degrees ranges from 2.4-2.8.

My career has developed mostly in language teaching. I am considering the option of becoming an officer either in the US Army or USAF. In the Army, I am a good fit for a Human Resources Officer, and in the USAF, I could potentially be an Intel Officer ( I did not find an HR officer on their website.

I am currently abroad, so I can't visit a recruiter. I am physically able to score 100 on the PT in both branches; however, I am approximately 30lb overweight for my age group. I'm 5'10'' with 220lb.

Also, I don't have any tattoos; however, I have a couple on my bucket list, and I might get them this year.

I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this goal.

,Army,"Have you checked the HRC trends report for your MOS?  HRC periodically issues statistics not simply on the promotion point cut-off score for each MOS for promotion to SGT and SSG, but also publishes a look at the distribution of eligible soldiers by their current promotion points.  The attached chart is created from one of these HRC reports: SSG\_SGT-Eligibles-Trend-Report with the most recent being dated 4 DEC 2023.

In the chart, ranges of promotion points are shown on the horizontal axis (e.g. 24-49 points).  The bars represent a count of the SSG eligible soldiers and show the actual number above the bar.

If you are working towards promotion, this will give a clearer sense of where you stand relative to others in your MOS on promotion points.  Then you can strategize on ways to strengthen your position or to coach your soldiers.

As context using 11B, the SSG promo points cut-off for Oct, Nov, and Dec was 360, 357, and 396 points, respectively.  Also, in Dec 2023, there are 1220 SSG eligibles developing and moving towards promotion.  The average point score is 287 and average cut-off score over recent months is 365.

How does the distribution strike you?

Can I get Ranger School after OSUT?

Hello, I am currently enlisting in the army national guard as an 11b. I’m curious if I could get ranger school after osut. I saw that one of the newer recruits got it and he went to ranger school, air assault school and airborne school straight after osut.

Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.

Background, i’m 16, in highschool, and i’ve been very interested in the service my whole life. I’m not bad at school, my grades are very good and i’m in all advance classes. I’m considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i’ve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don’t know much, pretty little actually and I’m planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!

Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.

I'm about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I'm looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I'll be recycled if I don't meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don't pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won't kick me out, right?

I'll continue pushing. I don't know how long it takes, but I just worry they'll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn't care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.

Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn't qualified due to weight)

It's no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I've seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created. Give the Shadow guys a place to discuss the future of the MOS along with advice on what to do going forward.

Also, any advice on being reclassed? How the process starts and about how many offerings they give? Asking for a friend...

I’m 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I’ll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I’m mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I’ll regret it from what I hear from videos I’ve watched. I’ve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS’s I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS’s do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!

(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don’t have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.

My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y’all. the recruiter has said I won’t be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn’t need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn’t get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn’t get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying “you CAN get an option 4”, then immediately someone else is telling me “You CANT get an option 4” As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don’t “get a number” whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.

Should recruiters let you know when they’re on leave? I’ve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they’ll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it’s submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he’s been on leave for a little over a week. I didn’t know, he just disappeared and they’ve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.

Shipping FEB 5th to OSUT then Off to Germany as a 19D... ONLY option 19 to germany in my contract... Question is :   ""COULD"" I volunteer and get airborne during OSUT and potentially go 1-91 with the 173rd? or am I most likely going to 2CR  with no chance at an European Airborne unit?

I went to meps about a year ago and failed the hearing test twice, submitted a waiver and got denied. I was told I can go back to meps and try again and plan on going within the next month.

Has anybody had any experiences like this and gotten accepted to enlist? Any tips on what I can do to improve my chances of passing, or advice in general would be appreciated.

Been thinking about reclassing. I remember when I went through my MOS school the first time (AIT), that you could speed up the process and just take the test for that particular class week, and passing it would advance your progress. I don't remember what it was called. Can anyone help so I can look up the details?

What is AIT like?

I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS's at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. 

Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? 

What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I'm in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?

Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?

How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn't within walking distance?

I have a ton of questions, but I can't think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.

Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.

1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?

There's a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I'm in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.

I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.

2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?

Jobs

Prior service here, looking to go back into my original MOSs but it’s under precision retention so idk how that’s gonna go. 

My grade determination came back and it said I have to choose from 35F, 35G, 35P, 35T, and 88H to keep my grade. 

Anyone know how life is in those MOSs? What’s the day to day job like? What type of units would I be in?Trying to figure out what I should choose as a back up option.

Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 🤦‍♂️They didn’t clean my ears so I assume they didn’t see a reason to. From what I know, I don’t have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can’t tell you the exact scores because I don’t remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I’m not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.

I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m

I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can't. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.

I’m 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don’t have to, but I have to live with her and she’s my legal guardian, and she’s a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren’t getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I’m going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don’t know about the “permanentness” (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she’ll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I’m trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I’m walking into tommorow and Thursday.  
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)

I am joining Army Reserve - 27d (not official  yet still have to go through MEPS). Hoping yall could help me out with some questions. 

•recruiter mentioned I may be able to skip some AIT because my civilian job is closely related. I haven’t been able to find out much about this. I’m not sure if I should do that or just go get the actual army training. Anyone have any advice? 
• I want to deploy (hopefully to some place interesting) sooner rather than later. How much of a say do I get as a reserve member about timeline and location? Could there be any chance of coming back from training and leaving within a month or so?

Hi everyone, 

I'm about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I'm currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don't want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. 

For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. 

Thanks in advance.

Did I do the MEPS hearing test wrong twice?

I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it’s performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row? I need to know if I failed due to my own negligence or because I genuinely have hearing issues.

Hello everyone,

This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I’m 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.

I’m a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS’s I was offered either 13B or 19K. I’d like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I’m stupid but I’m interested in both MOS’s. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I’d have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m being very indecisive.

What are the Female Physical Requirements?

I’m enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don’t necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as “rucking”, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I’m new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.

&lt;p&gt;Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background, i’m 16, in highschool, and i’ve been very interested in the service my whole life. I’m not bad at school, my grades are very good and i’m in all advance classes. I’m considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i’ve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don’t know much, pretty little actually and I’m planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s the deal w/ challenge coins? I see it spread to civ jobs too, with those coins to commemorate some event. Maybe it&amp;#39;s just my nomadic situation talking with little space to spare but I&amp;#39;d rather have something I can use, even a tshirt lol, than something that won&amp;#39;t have any use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I&amp;#39;m looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I&amp;#39;ll be recycled if I don&amp;#39;t meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don&amp;#39;t pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won&amp;#39;t kick me out, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll continue pushing. I don&amp;#39;t know how long it takes, but I just worry they&amp;#39;ll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn&amp;#39;t care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn&amp;#39;t qualified due to weight)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I&amp;#39;ve seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created.

&lt;p&gt;Has anyone ever got or heard of getting a medical waiver for a past shoulder dislocation (mine was in 2017) get approved? Like how lenient is the army on approving that kind of stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been out almost two years in March. Thinking of reenlisting. Would I have to go back to BCT?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I’ll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I’m mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I’ll regret it from what I hear from videos I’ve watched. I’ve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS’s I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS’s do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m new to the Reddit community. I tried to post earlier but it wasn’t approved. I don’t understand why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone is on antidepressants right now, can they join the army?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If someone had a minor fracture(not a break) in their hand in the last 4 years, without needing a cast or anything, will they be disqualified joining the army?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I scored 90 on asvab and my recruiter and family saying not go to infantry. My recruiter trying to push nurse but I’m not joining the army to be a fucking nurse. 5,10 155 pretty fit. Any advice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kd21ald/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don’t have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y’all. the recruiter has said I won’t be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn’t need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn’t get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn’t get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying “you CAN get an option 4”, then immediately someone else is telling me “You CANT get an option 4” As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don’t “get a number” whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family is putting together a shadowbox to commemorate my dad&amp;#39;s service, and we were struggling to find what a specific unit pact should look like. Are there any dedicated resources that might provide pictures of what to look for and from what years? We are trying to find what the exact patch he would have had being part of JCSE at MacDill in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should recruiters let you know when they’re on leave? I’ve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they’ll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it’s submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he’s been on leave for a little over a week. I didn’t know, he just disappeared and they’ve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shipping FEB 5th to OSUT then Off to Germany as a 19D... ONLY option 19 to germany in my contract... Question is :   &amp;quot;COULD&amp;quot; I volunteer and get airborne during OSUT and potentially go 1-91 with the 173rd? or am I most likely going to 2CR  with no chance at an European Airborne unit?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been thinking about reclassing. I remember when I went through my MOS school the first time (AIT), that you could speed up the process and just take the test for that particular class week, and passing it would advance your progress. I don&amp;#39;t remember what it was called. Can anyone help so I can look up the details?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;can i go to MEPS and not sign a contract? my recruiter is telling me that i’ll go to meps for a physical and ASVAB, then come back and wait for an opening and i can sign the enlistment papers whenever i want&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is AIT like?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS&amp;#39;s at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I&amp;#39;m in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn&amp;#39;t within walking distance?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a ton of questions, but I can&amp;#39;t think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I&amp;#39;m in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kdkxgmn/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 🤦‍♂️They didn’t clean my ears so I assume they didn’t see a reason to. From what I know, I don’t have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can’t tell you the exact scores because I don’t remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I’m not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a criminal history with no charges and some hand tattoos how likely is it to get multiple waivers approved as 32 yr old male? just began talking with a recruiter today and he said he did not want to give me false hope but he would be talking to his boss and be in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can&amp;#39;t. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don’t have to, but I have to live with her and she’s my legal guardian, and she’s a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren’t getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I’m going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don’t know about the “permanentness” (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she’ll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I’m trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I’m walking into tommorow and Thursday.&lt;br/&gt;
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I&amp;#39;m currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don&amp;#39;t want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I do the MEPS hearing test wrong twice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it’s performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row? I need to know if I failed due to my own negligence or because I genuinely have hearing issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I’m 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a buddy who’s looking to join with me. He’s just worried about his genital psoriasis. He said it doesn’t bother him at all and it’s just a few red marks. He was never diagnosed by a doctor for it but he’s worried when he would go through MEPs a doctor would see it and disqualify him. What are your thoughts? Thank you in advance for the help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently a dep for 17E which I will be shipping out in sep of 2024 but as im looking more into 35t I feel like this mos could provide me with better opportunities after my contract. Any input on which mos would be better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/army/comments/18fr4sq/weekly_question_thread_12112023_to_12172023/kf6c8xf/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link to Comment Chain&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS’s I was offered either 13B or 19K. I’d like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I’m stupid but I’m interested in both MOS’s. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I’d have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m being very indecisive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the Female Physical Requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don’t necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as “rucking”, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp;amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I’m new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Long story short, upon coming home for HBL, I found out my wife was dealing coke. We are separated atm, and she resides in the mainland currently.

,Army,"I'm facing a unique challenge regarding my citizenship status that's hindering my ability to obtain a security clearance. I was born in South Africa, and my family immigrated to the US when I was young. My father obtained US citizenship while I was under his custody, making me a derived citizen. The catch is, I lack paperwork aside from an outdated passport confirming my US citizenship.

I've worked through my chain of command up to the Brigade level with limited success. The Army recognizes me as a US citizen but also insists I still hold South African citizenship. To resolve this, I believe I need paperwork renouncing my South African citizenship and possibly a certificate affirming my US citizenship. However, the process is unclear, and every visit to my S2 results in changing requirements.

My biggest hurdle is dealing with the South African government. Despite numerous attempts over 8 months, I've received minimal to no assistance. After an in-person visit to the consulate in NY, I acquired the renouncement paperwork, but it requires approval from South Africa, a process that could take up to six months.

It's been a month and a half with no updates, and my inquiries remain unanswered. I lack faith in the South African government and fear I might never see the required paperwork. Additionally, I've received conflicting information on whether the renouncement alone is sufficient or if I need additional documents like an N600.

While I understand a security clearance isn't mandatory for Army service, it's preventing me from attending SERE school and reclassing to EOD. I've exhausted my resources seeking guidance and haven't received clear answers.

If any of you have faced a similar situation or have advice on navigating this complex process, I would greatly appreciate your insights. Thanks for the help.

I was also told that you could clear CIF before your CSP but you need ETS orders but you can’t get those until you’re 90-180 days out.

,Army,"Officer with ADSO that ends May 2026 with a matching PCS anticipated for that same summer. 

Let’s say I want to get out and go to grad school. Admissions acceptance letters for my program are typically announced between January-March  for an August 15 start date of the same calendar year. 

How do I figure out all the time hacks for this process? The program often allows deferred acceptance (not guaranteed) so I’m planning to apply in 2025. However, I’m trying to plan ahead in case I don’t get into my program of choice. If I don’t get into any great programs, I might reconsider staying in (I’ve got good chances for promotion based on my corps’ stats and my record).

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say I want to get out and go to grad school. Admissions acceptance letters for my program are typically announced between January-March  for an August 15 start date of the same calendar year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do I figure out all the time hacks for this process? The program often allows deferred acceptance (not guaranteed) so I’m planning to apply in 2025. However, I’m trying to plan ahead in case I don’t get into my program of choice. If I don’t get into any great programs, I might reconsider staying in (I’ve got good chances for promotion based on my corps’ stats and my record).&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I’m calling all lifers and mainly people who’ve done 10+ years to give me their opinion. 





So I’m currently a PFC and a mechanic posting this on a burner account so 1SG doesn’t know. But anyway here’s my plan: Finish out current 4 year contract and reenlist for another 3-4 years active changing MOS with the hope of getting an overseas duty station and a bonus. After that reenlist into guard or reserve and complete the rest of my service in that and retire at 20 years. I may be wrong on how that works so please correct me.





So far I’ve been in the regular for almost a year and I do like it. I feel like most of my gripes and dislikes are because of the MOS I’m in. I don’t like being a mechanic. Crawling under humvees, loud trucks, being covered in grease everyday. Especially when we don’t have any work and they put us on a random task or do someone else job.




My plan is to 100% switch MOSs into the most POGiest MOS that doesn’t go to the field often, easy on the body and I’m not ashamed to admit it. I want to do my job and just mine no one else’s. Pretty much admin work I would assume fits that criteria. I see so many young soldiers my age just not give af about their health or what they do to their body. Imagine being made fun of for attempting to get 8 hours of sleep. It’s absolutely pathetic. Being a mechanic and in the Army is especially hard on your body And I don’t want to be broken at 30. 







I don’t want to do all the high speed schools or other branches like being a drill sergeant. I see a lot of younger soldiers who give higher ranked shit and their fellow younger soliders shit because they don’t have a CAB or don’t wear any patches. I do agree that those who go the extra mile should be rewarded but is it right to have the “if you ain’t us you ain’t shit” mentality towards others for it?





Is I know me saying all of this has you thinking why didn’t I just join the Airforce well I was but stuff happened and I’m in the Army.

,Army,"My ETS date was back in March of 2010. I’m coming back close to 14 years later, yes with a reduced rank. I should be going into MEPS for the physical and career decision this coming Tuesday. 

I’m a lot older now, I haven’t really done much since I’ve been out. Misc. jobs from software analyst, to managing Amazon, and various IT positions. 

When it comes to IT certs I only have A+ (expired a few years back but the knowledge is never lost). 

They have a 25B IT specialist mos available with a 10k sign on. Last year there was no sign on bonus for it. 

I’ve gone through most postings through online/reddit about this mos. I know once AIT is done it’s all unit dependent on what I’ll actually be doing. But with only having an A+ is the AIT difficult? I’ve taken a few other classes ranging from NET+ and Sec+, also windows 10 server from this shitty trade school in AZ. No certifications for those though.  I’m not necessarily the smartest person, but I feel I am average at learning things related to IT. 

Then there’s 35F, intelligence analyst. 7.5k sign on bonus. I get I won’t be doing analyst work, probably details and volunteer shit. But it sounds easy and I could probably study more IT certs while in this mos. Also, I’ve read promotion points are easier with 35F compared to 25B. 

I want to be set up by the time I ETS again if I don’t retire from the army. I’m trying to be smart about it this time. I was just a kid back then. After two tours I just wanted to get out with no plan. That was dumb of me.

,Army,"**BLUF: the Army places too much emphasis on ACFT scores and needs to start caring more about actual professional development when it comes to promotions, OMLs, etc.**

When the ACFT was first announced, it made sense as a concept. The APFT had a lot of issues: it caused injuries (situps are bad), it wasn't representative of holistic fitness, and it was super easy to game. Creating a new fitness assessment that was based more closely on what soldiers would have to do during combat made a lot of sense. We all know that didn't go as well as it could have. Let's quickly go through some highlights from the ACFT's struggles:

* It started off as a sex and age neutral test, only having different categories based on MOS. This made a ton of sense.

* An overwhelming majority of women failed the leg tuck, so it was replaced with an option to do a plank. Then, the plank replaced the leg tuck altogether.

* The test was revised to have age and gender categories.

* Congress told the Army not to do that, we didn't listen, and the fate of the test was in limbo once again.

* The new NDAA lets us keep sex-based assessment, but requires stricter standards for combat MOSs.

Personally, I think the ACFT's original method of grading made more sense than anything else we've ever done. Grading by sex and/or age seems silly to me when the battlefield doesn't care about those things. Indirect fire doesn't bracket you more slowly if you're old; your 250 pound (in kit) battle buddy who got shot doesn't weigh less if you're a woman. Soldiers should all be judged by their ability (or lack thereof) to meet **the standard**, whatever we determine that is.

I was having a conversation with a female soldier recently about all of this, and she mentioned that she was in favor of the sex-based grading for the ACFT because doing otherwise was unfair to females when it came to things like promotion points, OMLs for schools, and anything else where your score matters are more than just a method of assessing fitness. She's not wrong, but she's complaining about a symptom when she thinks she's talking about a root issue.

The root issue is that **the Army places FAR too much weight on fitness assessments** for things like promotions, who gets to go to what school, or selections for support personnel to SOF units. The best example of this is how promotion points are calculated. a maxed PT test is nearly worth more than the most you can achieve by maxing out PME and correspondence courses *combined*. how does that make sense? Is it just laziness, because a PT test is easier to grade than doing the work and combing through the various military professional development and MOS-specific courses and deciding what they should be worth? Or is the old joke about how soldiers are meatheads at heart little more true than we want it to be?

&lt;p&gt;But, I know it&amp;#39;s a political move to attend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinions? Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poll numbers seem to be in favor of attending, and leaving when alcohol is served. I suspect that will have to be my course of action. Where does one rent a date? &lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Need some S1 help here, I've ran into an issue.
Gonna try to keep this as vague as possible

TLDR
Failed acft during 1st contract in the Reserves, deployed, got out, came back in and am now running into issues with a temp promotion as well as a possible work around.

Here's a little back story of everything first.
First contract was in the Reserves. Due to my original unit disbanding, I was sent to an entirely different unit and had to go back to AIT to receive an additional MOS as ASI. 
Manage to locate a unit in the Midwest and transferred over there to do my original MOS.
Before one drill date I had broken up with a long time ex, and decided to just drive down to drill with my dog since I wasn't taking care of myself. At the end of drill, was told to do a walk on BLC course, was not prepared physically or mentally.
Took and failed the ACFT, but probably would have been kicked out anyways due to not having any of the required packing list other than a couple uniforms, let alone I was sleeping with my dog in my truck.

Fast forward a bit, volunteered for a deployment. Enjoyed the beginning of it, but due to things happening at the end of it I went to the SRU. During my time at the SRU, somehow I was scheduled for a BLC slot. Even had I known, I wouldn't have been able to go to that BLC slot due to receiving care. Decided to get out of the Army for awhile directly afterwards because of reasons, left with an HD. 

Fast forward a bit more, missed the Army and decided to go active this time. Wanted more certifications that the Army would provide and I just missed it. 

Coming into the Army was a mess, recruiter messed up my paperwork and I was hit with a Fraudulent Enlistment, had my SC revoked for a little bit and got it back. Was a pain but got through all of that and was happy to get to my next duty station to do my job. 
Found out my TIS and BASD wasnt correct and met with retention to fix that, she submitted the documents to IPERMs and I in return gave them to my S1. When I finally looked at my ippsa profile, everything was wrong. TIS, TIG, BASD, previous units(appereantly Ive got 20 or so different listing in the same UIC), deployments

This marked the beginning of my issues with S1. Had so many issues with me submitting my college, awards, deployments and everything else. I would submit them, make appointments and nothing would get done and only managed to get my awards uploaded because I stayed there until I watched them do it because I wanted to pick up.

Once that was done, my points were looking good minus my college. I killed the P Board, had a BLC date set and a week before broke my toe because of a soldier smacking a 88m tow bar we were carrying causing us to all to drop it.
For some reason though, I was not populating on the OML even though I had secured the BLC slot.

By the time my toe healed, I was deployed. Tried to get promoted because I had made points twice since getting my P status at that point however my name never populated on the list.

Since then, I've submitted 3 Pars, each one with more and more information detailing reasons and supporting documents.
This last one stated that it was because I have a history of failed BLC slots, in particular the one I had in the Reserves in my first contract before my break in service. 
I've checked ATTRS, and the 2 slots I had after that first one were med releases. However, after thoroughly checking my Iperms I could not locate the 1059 for the Reserves BLC slot. After calling the schoolhouse and speaking to them, they informed me it was up to the unit at the time to upload it which they never did and that they didn't have the record of it in their paper system.

Ive heard so much about what could be wrong, and what I should do and how, that I finally said enough and was hoping someone who knows their S1 stuff can help me out.

Things I've heard and been told so far:

•I'm barred from Enlistment due to the failed BLC slot 
-If that were the case i wouldn't have been able     to come back in, I even had retention check it out and they verified that I have no flag and I'm not barred
•TIS isn't accurate in IPPSA so that's the reason I'm not populating on the OML and not getting promoted
•Need the CGs permission to go to BLC and have a copy of the 1059 in question (which was never uploaded)
•Reserves stuff doesn't fully transfer over so I should be good
•No record of the 1059 for the failed BLC so just call HRC and ask them to remove it
-This just feels sketchy
•I just have to wait till I'm able to get another walk on slot
-I hope that's not the case, because I'm losing motivation fast because everything is all messed up and I feel that I'm only now being semi helped because of reasons.


There's so much more also going on. I was supposed to transfer to another unit that has a much better S1 and has walk on capabilities for BLC, but now I can't because the receiving CSM doesn't want to do a swap for swap, so now I'm awaiting a open door meeting with my current CSM to see if they're willing to give me away so I can finally get my career progression moving forward.

,Army,"Hey everyone,

I'm a sergeant and I've got a bit of a situation with one of my soldiers that I could use some advice on. This troop has been under a flag for two years now, but there's been no punishment handed down or even a formal reading. It's a bit of an odd situation, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

From my perspective, it doesn't seem fair to the soldier to be left hanging like this. It's impacting their morale and potentially their career progression. I believe in maintaining discipline, but this just doesn't sit right with me.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that this soldier has proactively sought help from behavioral health for other personal issues. They're actively engaged in counseling and are making a genuine effort to rehabilitate and improve themselves. This commitment to self-improvement and mental health is commendable and, in my opinion, should be factored into how we handle their flag status. It shows a level of responsibility and self-awareness that I believe is a positive sign. 

I'm considering pushing this up the chain of command to get it resolved, either by removing the flag (if they've been squared away since it was placed) or by moving forward with whatever actions are deemed necessary if there are still unresolved issues.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to approach this with the higher-ups?

,Army,"Please bear with me so I can explain my situation- 
Advice and criticism is welcomed… 

First question. what is my MSO? Is it my original MSO (05/2024), my “reduced” MSO (05/2023, already passed) or did I fuck myself and give myself a new MSO out in 2026?

Second question, is it hard to go TPU to IRR these days? Nothing on the USARC share point mentions it not being a possible option, there’s an in depth walk through about how to do the process in iPPSA. Is anything about my situation going to cause problems with going IRR until I hit my MSO, whether it’s in 2024 or 2026?

Third question, does anyone have good things to say about IMA? I have a hard time believing there is a real job opening that I’m qualified for where I can just “show up when I feel like it”. That sounds like the “no colonel left behind fantasyland” for senior officers waiting to retire.

Situation:

Commissioned in 2016- 8 year MSO w/ 5 active years. No ragrets.

Ended up doing almost 7yr active duty, then I UQR’d. ETS date from AD of 3/31/2023

During my transition I had serious financial, employment, and health insurance (infant at home, sick wife) concerns.

Decided to give TPU life / USAR a try, as I have some friends that went that route and enjoy it. I was told at the time, and still am under the impression was a no-obligation-added move.

My ROCC sets me up with a transfer memo to where I don’t have any additional time added to MSO- I declined to take a bonus, but I did take the 36 month MOB deferment, and I take the 1 year MSO reduction, and I take the TAMP180 benefit. 

At the time of my ETS, my actual MSO end date was 05/2024. 
The 1 year MSO reduction would put me at 05/2023 (yes, a date in the past…)
So I go about my business the last 10 months or so, do what I need to do and show up to BA and be a team player. 

Now, however, my circumstances have changed and I need to get out. I have a 1 year old, I landed my dream civilian job, I have a heavy workload of traveling &amp; OT pay coming up over the next year. Not to mention I ended up with a higher-than-expected VA rating from active duty injuries. 

Because of civilian career obligations, I will be unable to do AT, and unable to drill most of this year due to work and calendar conflicts. No, I’m not willing to miss out on my civilian pay and benefits for USAR unless I have literally no option. 

From a cost-benefit standpoint, USAR is barely worth it: Factoring my VA debt from drill days, I make considerably less money in USAR on a per hourly basis. thus, if I’m going to miss 1/4 to 1/2 of my weekends to travel for my higher paying civilian job, it’s not worth it to give up another weekend of family time for the benefit we get from drill pay + tricare (I can get the best high deductible family plan from my employer for $200/mo more). 

Not to mention the considerable unpaid time sink of being a staff officer - and the PAIN IN THE ASS of dealing with owing a VA debt, and constantly having to stay on top of two careers. I am also feeling discouraged from the nonstop pay and personnel issues I’ve experienced, and seen other soldiers experience in my reserve unit. My heart isn’t in it anymore since I realized that the grass is actually a lot greener on the other side.

I see 3 options: IMA, IRR, or ETS. 

When I bring up this situation to my unit, they tell me OH HO HO you actually owe us 3 years, glhf. But nobody can produce a document that I signed that says I have another 3 year MSO… They also say that I won’t get accepted to IRR due to undermanning issues. 

So I guess according to them I can either go IMA, remote drill from my other job, or just take it on the chin? 

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.",t2_rcr7f18i9,False,,0,False,"Transition out? Or…? (O3, AD -&gt; USAR -&gt; ETS/IRR/…?)",[],r/army,False,7.0,,0,,,False,t3_18y7n8n,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1704354502.0,text,7.0,,,text,self.army,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please bear with me so I can explain my situation- 
Advice and criticism is welcomed… &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First question. what is my MSO? Is it my original MSO (05/2024), my “reduced” MSO (05/2023, already passed) or did I fuck myself and give myself a new MSO out in 2026?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second question, is it hard to go TPU to IRR these days? Nothing on the USARC share point mentions it not being a possible option, there’s an in depth walk through about how to do the process in iPPSA. Is anything about my situation going to cause problems with going IRR until I hit my MSO, whether it’s in 2024 or 2026?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third question, does anyone have good things to say about IMA? I have a hard time believing there is a real job opening that I’m qualified for where I can just “show up when I feel like it”. That sounds like the “no colonel left behind fantasyland” for senior officers waiting to retire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Situation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commissioned in 2016- 8 year MSO w/ 5 active years. No ragrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ended up doing almost 7yr active duty, then I UQR’d. ETS date from AD of 3/31/2023&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my transition I had serious financial, employment, and health insurance (infant at home, sick wife) concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decided to give TPU life / USAR a try, as I have some friends that went that route and enjoy it. I was told at the time, and still am under the impression was a no-obligation-added move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ROCC sets me up with a transfer memo to where I don’t have any additional time added to MSO- I declined to take a bonus, but I did take the 36 month MOB deferment, and I take the 1 year MSO reduction, and I take the TAMP180 benefit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of my ETS, my actual MSO end date was 05/2024. 
The 1 year MSO reduction would put me at 05/2023 (yes, a date in the past…)
So I go about my business the last 10 months or so, do what I need to do and show up to BA and be a team player. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, however, my circumstances have changed and I need to get out. I have a 1 year old, I landed my dream civilian job, I have a heavy workload of traveling &amp;amp; OT pay coming up over the next year. Not to mention I ended up with a higher-than-expected VA rating from active duty injuries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of civilian career obligations, I will be unable to do AT, and unable to drill most of this year due to work and calendar conflicts. No, I’m not willing to miss out on my civilian pay and benefits for USAR unless I have literally no option. &lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"
I’ll try to make this post as clear as possible. 
I went to an inpatient facility for drugs (opioid dependency disorder).. 

I am 20 and went once when I was 19 and once more I went back at 20. I had a problem with opioids and other substances. I detoxed and haven’t used since. 

While there the doctor prescribed me medication and said I was manic depressive and they put me on meds. I took them for about 2 weeks and hated the way they made me feel. I haven’t used drugs for over 9 months now and believe that part of my life is over. 

I know they use a new system called GENESIS. So lying doesn’t work anymore (from what I’ve read on other Reddit posts) I am wondering if I’m wasting both the recruiters and my time. 

I already signed all the paperwork and said I have NO medical history because that’s what I was told to do by older service members. The paperwork is already being processed and I should hear back in 2-3 days. Not going to bother asking for a waiver because the marines already submitted my paperwork to MEPS.

,Army,"I hate it here. And by here I mean my MOS, 56M, Religious Affairs Specialist (Chap Ass for you older folks.) “ Oh but it’s such a cake job” or “it’s so easy.” You’re right! It’s easy. 

The most incompetent NCOs I’ve ever met are in the Chaplain Corp. Why am I working at BN lvl writing SOPs for the UMTs in the BDE? Division doesn’t even contact my BDE NCO. They just call me. This isn’t my first unit and this has happened several times because “SSG Incompetent isn’t very reliable and we see that the Lower Enlisted Mikes don’t respect them.” Then move them out of that slot and put me there tf. These same SSGs sit at E-6 and just fester. They don’t try to promote or make themselves competitive because it’s so easy to have a cake job and sit on their asses until they retire. I, for the life of me, cannot understand how somebody could just sit and be so comfortable not progressing. This shit is so mind boggling. Every meeting we have to go to it’s always “if you find a soldier that wants to be a 56M make sure they are a high achiever, competitive, and have good character!” Mean while we’re over here retaining Chap Asses that pop hot, never show up on time (if they show up,) and have absolutely 0 discipline. Not only that but they’re just fucking weird. Was talking to one of my MGs today and he was telling me how weird every chap ass he’s ever met is (he’s at my house hanging out pretty often so obviously I’m not too weird.) I was at ALC and we had to talk to the personnel management NCO for our branch and it’s always the same “recruit good soldiers” speech. I asked him why if we’re just going to retain all the shitty ones. I didn’t get an answer but I did get a counseling for saying “shitty” and lost my graduation honors (still had 3rd highest gpa.) 

I’ve never had a BDE 56M that was worth a damn. It’s me and 1 other SGT working at the bn level and they’ve never been in FORSCOM. They didn’t know how to set up their kit or even what a kit was referring to when I went over to introduce myself. Deadass looked down at their chevrons and told me they (the chevrons)  didn’t mean anything because they (the NCO) had no idea what they were doing. We have 3 PFCs and 2 SPCs in the rest of the BNs and so I try to do training that is actually practical and useful that also doesn’t involve just sitting and watching a power point because I know our SSG at BDE is 0% useful and doesn’t train or try to develop these younger 56Ms. I’ve given up on making SSG. My window opens at the end of the month and my retention is already pulling a list of MOSs to reclass to. 

Sorry for my long rant. I just left my BDE 56Ms office since they can’t answer a phone or respond to email.

,Army,"Okay, so I injured my knee literally the day I flew out to my new unit. It feels so stupid really, but I literally misplaced my footing taking out trash/luggage and my knee popped 3 times and buckled. For a minute, couldn’t move or put any weight on it all. 
Got to my new duty station, went to the ER, x-ray shows nothing. A month later, I get an MRI and it shows that my knee has loose bodies, a small fracture, and some ligament tearing. Swelling has gone down, but still visible after walking for periods of time. Have a referral for a CT and orthopedics.
I will be pushing 3 months on temp profile before I get the appointments.
My knee did pop before in April ‘22 during the field, but it self-resolved in a matter of just walking it off.

,Army,"Edit: I already knew the answer to this question but I appreciate all the shared perspectives. This was a massive sticking point for me when I ETS’d because the Army demolished my final paycheck and other finances and it took a congressman stepping in to fix it because the Army is incompetent at even the most basic, mundane tasks. Hopefully, fingers crossed, that someone will see this and make a change. Of course we all know that won’t happen and we should focus on shaving 2x daily instead. 



I’ve never held a regular civilian job. I mostly did farm work and such, so I have no experience in the civilian sector. 

My question: Do civilian employers regularly fuck pay up like the Army does? I see so many posts on here about it and I’ve personally had a lot of pay issues through the Army, including not being paid at all for like 3 months when I was a barracks rat in 2016.

,Army,"You are offered a chance to change MOS. From 9 to 5, you use VR to step into other soldiers bodies, and control them. Your only goal is to make them pass their PT test, and once they pass, you are assigned a new PT failure to train.

* You feel everything they feel (All the pain!), but in real life, you're just sitting in a chair and wiggling around. So in real life, you're burning as much calories as the average gamer, regardless of how out of breath you feel in VR.
* You have a supervisor that watches your VR stream to ensure that you're working the soldier out and not shamming/sharping yourself. You or the soldier can still go to the bathroom privately; if you feel the soldier's urge to tinkle, you simply swap out. The PT Failure's eyes glow green, so everyone knows you're controlling them.
* You do your job at home, virtually. The only thing you pmcs is your headset. There is no other equipment, no uniform, no place of duty, no soldiers under you.
* You are still a soldier, so you still have the most basic responsibilities: Morning PT, medpros, certs, PCS to new units even, but as soon as you get home to do VR, you generally stay home; no COF.
* There is no end of failures to train. You're not expected to be a miracle worker, as you find out that some PT failures are truly hopeless. You also have to do PT tests for these soldiers about twice a week.
* You get lunch from 1130 to 1300.
* You still deploy, but you basically just wiggle for other people in other countries.
* You can rank up just like you normally would.

,Army,"I'm not saying that NCOs need to do full examination of their soldier's credit... but I think they should be talking to them about it! Arguably, one of the best benefits military/vets get is the VA home loan. They don't need perfect credit to capitalize on it, but they still need some credit. 

I had an NCO press me on it when I was a junior enlisted. My thoughts were that he was an old fart that was over stepping. He realized I had very limited knowledge on it and even helped me apply to a credit card that was soley meant for building credit. As a PFC, I was mainly doing it to shut him up. I followed the gameplan and watched my credit score continue to rise. Eventually.. I was able to buy a house with 0 down payment. I'll always be thankful for that NCO.

When I finally became an NCO, I was eager to help my soldiers' credit grow. However, I was always cautious not to overstep. I talked to my soldiers about it over lunch and they were receptive. I didn't discuss it again besides to answer questions. One soldier, about 6 months later, was eager to show me his score increase and referenced our discussion. As I'm reflecting on my time in the army (just ended), this moment became a proud one that I keep coming back to.

Yes. We all get a finance class that skims over the subject. Let's not pretend we've paid attention through every army brief. I don't think NCOs are responsible for every financial decision that their subordinates make. However, the NCOs I surrounded myself with always wanted to make lasting impacts on their soldiers' and battle buddies' lives. This is a very simple way that can turn out to be extremely beneficial. You don't have to do it like I did it. You don't have to do it like my NCO did it. I mean shit..  you don't really have to do it at all. I would just encourage you to do so.

,Army,"I have not been dealing well with Army life as a whole lately and im unsure of what to do. Seeing as im so new to the Army and I havent even made it out of AIT yet I feel like a pussy for even feeling like this. I just dont enjoy anything anymore. Nothing I used to do before makes me happy. I dont feel like im my own person anymore, like Im just kinda watching my own life pass me by helplessly; sometimes I dont even feel like im real. It is extremely difficult for me to unwind at the end of the day because I simply dont have time to waste without sacrificing precious sleep that I already have so little of. And even then, All the time would be spent anxiously worrying about every little thing there is to worry about. Im on edge 24/7 and it fucks with my head so much that I cant concentrate. Im kinda stuck in a weird limbo of fight or flight and its absolute torture; and the worst part is I dont even know why im so on edge. Hell, sometimes its so bad I wake up in the middle of the night in a full blown panic attack for no reason. Sometimes I wake up and my throat is closing up and I cant breathe or my heart is in so much pain I think im dying. Lately, I've begun to have uncontrollable thoughts about suicide and all the ways I could do it. It worries me because I wasnt the kind of person to even think about suicide but now Im afraid one day I just wont be able to take it anymore and I might do it impulsively. But im also afraid that if I reach out for help that it would be a career ender (I probably wouldnt be able to keep my clearance). I've thought about it but I dont wanna go to BH and be ""that guy"". I dont want my leadership to frown upon me for not being able to cope. I dont want to have to fuck over my battle buddies by having to be add a suicide watch on top of the CQ and fireguard shifts that already take countless hours of sleep from them. Whats worse is that my physical conditions are beginning to catch up with me aswell. I have asthma and had a heart surgery for supraventricular tachycardia before joining (I got waivers for both) and its really starting to show during morning PT. I can barely do CD1 without having my heart feeling like its gonna explode and being completely out of breath and wheezing by the end. And thats not even mentioning my knees or my back, I feel like my knee is going to shatter everytime I stand up and my back is so stiff I cant stay in the same position for too long or I wont be able to move. I've thought about all of the ways that I could reach out for help and each one is going to hold me back or get me sent home. I dont have shit except my wife back at home, and she is living at her parents (we dont have our own place). I dont even have a car at home, but at this point I would be more than happy to go back. The reason I left home in the first place was to be able to give us a place to live and money to live on, but is it worth my life?

My question is:

What do I do? do I ask my leadership to just send me tf home so I can atleast get out alive? do I get help and risk losing everything or dragging myself through the mud? do I just tough it out and hope I dont off myself?

It worries me because I wasnt the kind of person to even think about suicide but now Im afraid one day I just wont be able to take it anymore and I might do it impulsively. But im also afraid that if I reach out for help that it would be a career ender (I probably wouldnt be able to keep my clearance). I&amp;#39;ve thought about it but I dont wanna go to BH and be &amp;quot;that guy&amp;quot;. I dont want my leadership to frown upon me for not being able to cope. I dont want to have to fuck over my battle buddies by having to be add a suicide watch on top of the CQ and fireguard shifts that already take countless hours of sleep from them. Whats worse is that my physical conditions are beginning to catch up with me aswell. I have asthma and had a heart surgery for supraventricular tachycardia before joining (I got waivers for both) and its really starting to show during morning PT. I can barely do CD1 without having my heart feeling like its gonna explode and being completely out of breath and wheezing by the end. And thats not even mentioning my knees or my back, I feel like my knee is going to shatter everytime I stand up and my back is so stiff I cant stay in the same position for too long or I wont be able to move. I&amp;#39;ve thought about all of the ways that I could reach out for help and each one is going to hold me back or get me sent home. I dont have shit except my wife back at home, and she is living at her parents (we dont have our own place). I dont even have a car at home, but at this point I would be more than happy to go back. The reason I left home in the first place was to be able to give us a place to live and money to live on, but is it worth my life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My question is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do I do? do I ask my leadership to just send me tf home so I can atleast get out alive? do I get help and risk losing everything or dragging myself through the mud? do I just tough it out and hope I dont off myself? Im not sure whats right or wrong anymore and I need help.&lt;/p&gt;

He told me to button my back pocket and then asked if I knew how many buttons BDUs had (I enlisted in 2007) and proceeded to berate me because I &amp;quot;can&amp;#39;t even handle 8 buttons on the ACUs.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh also gimme three cheesy bean burritos and 2 spicy potato tacos because my son is a vegetarian&lt;/p&gt;

Its just that the same post keeps getting posted, with the same responses. I don't see how its any different than any other low effort spam post type. (Who knows, maybe I'm guilty of the same thing here)

,Army,"What’s going in BCT and AIT? Do they just not teach discipline and standards anymore? I’m seeing a lot of posts on here about seeing new soldiers or some trainees in the Airport looking like jackasses in uniform. Ive had my experience from this when going home on HBL with people wearing and doing the absolute dumbest shit. It looks incredibly bad on you the individual, the Army, and your drill sergeants when you walk around the airport with headphones and sunglasses while looking down on your phone. Yes, there are the ones and two’s who doe this type of behavior but one solider represents the whole Army so one person doing it is enough to create any sort of problem. 




I mainly blame the drill sergeants for not correcting this type of behavior. As they are their NCOs they should be ensuring this stuff does not happen. I feel like this is an unpopular opinion to blame the drills on trainees behavior but they’re the ones who are tasked to turn civilians into soldiers. They’re your first respreatation of what right should look like and who you’re supposed to look up to. It’s their duty to make sure the uniform is worn with respect and like your proud to be a solider. 




I see a lot of posts also on the marines in uniform in Airport looking sharp and squared away and I have to agree with them. Marines have us beat when it comes to discipline out of basic. 




I’ll take the DFAC Special, please.





__Edit:__ This post has been extremely popular in the last few hours. I received a lot of criticism, some of it was warranted. I honestly got worried at one point that it’d get taken down and I’d get permanently banned from the sub with the amount of shit and downvotes I was getting but I’m glad the mods did not do that. 





Current drill sergeants and senior ranking members all showed me the other side of the spectrum and much shit I don’t know. I will admit I was combative and argumentative in the comments. There’s a lot about being an NCO I don’t know and it was good to have the conversation with everyone about it.

,Army,"I  (19F) will be shipping out to basic training at the end of the month to Fort Jackson, I will be going in as a 12W. I still have a bunch of questions about basic training, if anyone could respond I would be very grateful.

1. What is basic training like for a young female, specifically in Fort Jackson?
2. Do they give you a pack of underwear/ socks or do you have to buy that yourself?
3. What happens if you run out of shampoo/ other hygiene products? Can you request to go to the PX or do you just have to bear with it?
4. I hate styling my hair because it is thick so I'm thinking of cutting it to where I can barley put it in a small ponytail, would that be alright or are there certain hairstyles I have to get?
5. A recruiter told me that the money put in the Eagle Cash card can't be transferred to your credit card after graduating so can I decide how much of my paycheck goes into the card?
6. I want to save as much money from basic training as possible, any tips on how to do that would be great.
7. Do I get to use my phone when calling my family or is there a specific phone in the barracks that I have to use?

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is basic training like for a young female, specifically in Fort Jackson?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do they give you a pack of underwear/ socks or do you have to buy that yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What happens if you run out of shampoo/ other hygiene products? Can you request to go to the PX or do you just have to bear with it?&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A recruiter told me that the money put in the Eagle Cash card can&amp;#39;t be transferred to your credit card after graduating so can I decide how much of my paycheck goes into the card?&lt;/li&gt;

,Army,"Hello Army community,

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of my first posts to the Army community, reddit in general. 

I'm a young, age 24, single, newly promoted E-5 with plans on re-enlisting for a 4-year contract. (I have about a year left of my current contract.)

My current MOS is a 12R (Interior Electrician). 

&amp;#x200B;

This is going to be super transparent.

I spent my first couple years out of high school in college, made more mistakes than I thought were possible, and dropped out with 73 credit hours towards a business degree at a hefty price of $22,000 of Debt.

My original plan coming into the Army was to change my status from a liability to and asset (get out of debt and learn a skill), use my experience from my MOS to get into an IBEW Journeyman electrician apprenticeship program, and to leave with an honorable discharge. More general context, I wanted to build and have the opportunity to continuously build value in character I'm becoming, and I was in an environment that was killing that growth. (My first priority = The character I'm becoming)

Currently, 2 out of 3 of the goals are going according to plan. I've brought my debt from $22,000 to \~$12,000 with estimated date of completion no later than October of this year and have been keeping my nose clean. My goal of transferring my experience from my MOS to the civilian world is astray. First, the only time I've done my job was for our 6-week AIT (Little / no experience). Second, I've got a really bad taste in my mouth of what it means to be an ""Electrician"". More so, I look at myself in the mirror and feel like I haven't completed what I came in for, for lack of better words. 

I'm currently attached to unit specialized in dealing with high voltage electricity, MOS is 12P, and hate the working environment. Everyone is in there 30's or up, everyone is married, PT is a last priority, low reward for competition, extremely slow working tempo, and there is limited opportunity of growth other than what is in the scope of pursuing an MOS to 12P. I'm urgently planning on getting out of the unit ASAP.  

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly needed to get that out and put it out into the world. 

Build again and construct a new plan. 

Maybe some of you can relate.

&amp;#x200B;

I was recently given some advice / encouragement from my leadership that I should consider getting my education as a plan #2 in case the Army doesn't work out. I'm reluctant to start talking classes. Quite honestly, I'm scared. 

I've done some research and have taken some interest in a BA of Economics with future looks of double majoring in Stats.

,Army,"15D aircraft power train repairer. SPC, been in 5 years and 7ish months. I’ve only got 5 months left in the army and my unit pushed for a BLC slot. I’ve just started today and I’m terrified I’m not gonna pass it. I’m not the brightest, not a leader, not the fastest learner. I know my job in and out, have awards for outstanding maintenance and performance. But being an NCO is too much. My fear for not passing is that I get flagged or barred and become ineligible for a CSP on my way out. I’ve already got one lined up so I can have a job and afford a place when I get out. But it all hinges on passing BLC. My unit never does drill and ceremony or army PRT. No formalities and it’s gym on your own for PT. So I know nothing about any of this BLC stuff. I’ve tried learning all the stuff for the course but I can’t even get the nco creed memorized let alone the PRT or D&amp;C.

Are there any ways to get out of the course without getting barred or flagged? Any ways to avoid a bar or flag if I do fail the course? Any way to do a CSP even if I’m barred or flagged?

,Army,"Dear SMA,

How to fix the army in a few easy steps:

1) get your head out of your butt

2) hire me. I'm currently working on my Master's to be a therapist, so I know how to listen. 

3) pay me $50k and send me around the country (and OCONUS) for a year. I'll go base to base in birkenstocks and shorts and take soldiers out for lunch—the normal guys. The terminal E4, the PFC struggling but *trying* to pass their H/W, the SSG whose brother died and yet the SSG can't go home for the funeral because leadership said so. Give me a budget of $40 x working day to buy these dudes lunch and hear what's going on in their life

4) I'll take detailed notes, and at the end of the year we will synthesize all the information and create a weekend/weeklong course for senior leadership. 

5) we take a number of groups of senior leadership through this course about how to deal with soldier issues in ""the new army"", starting with not denying emergency leave just because we need the soldier ""just in case""

6) make it very clear that this is an order and failure to treat soldiers like humans will result in adverse action

,Army,"So I need some advice because no one in my unit really wants to help me with medical issues that I'm having. I've been diagnosed with chronic anxiety which just showed up out of nowhere before annual training last year and I knew there was nothing to be worried about but it still happened. I've turned in medical records for all of that. I also developed gastroesophical reflux disease (GERD) along with chronic IBS and chronic gastritis which causes me severe stomach pain especially when I'm stressed. My COC knows about all of this and it has been sent in writing along with documentation from doctors that is signed. I have a pending medical profile but I still have people (especially my PSG) saying that since I'm not technically on profile yet that nothing will happen to help me with this since they cannot cover their own a**es. The commander had previously agreed in November to let me RST because the chaos during a weekend at my unit stresses me TF out to the point that I'm in extreme physical pain and cannot sleep at night before and during. I know this seems quite extreme over a drill weekend and I don't understand myself why I'm having these issues but it is what it is I guess. Anyways, I get word 3 days ago that I had to be at drill this weekend from my PSG and it was per the 1SG so I had conflicting information (in my eyes) from the commander and 1SG. I reached out to the full-time staff because I had to go to my unit and get a new CAC as mine was about to expire so I didn't think anything of it and I went to S1 who is actually super helpful and asked about this. I was told to call back that afternoon after she had her meeting with the commander and I did when our S3 sergeant answered the phone and was an absolute smart a** and was like we will see you Saturday. Anyways, I then proceeded to get extremely stressed and got sick so I went to the doctor and got a medical excuse. I sent that in only to get crawled about ignoring COC and that I must fulfill my duties to the army reserves. I was told that I would be excused from drill but would not be able to make it up when I know of another person in my platoon that was allowed to RST this weekend. I'm kind of at a standstill right now because all of my medical conditions which are chronic are being ignored and I don't know how to get this situation handled. I can't go up the COC because my unit will not allow anyone to know how to get in contact with anyone above them in order to get things corrected. There was another soldier who had an injury during an FTX and filed two congressional complaints after the unit did not compensate him for his injury or get him medical care and still nothing was done to help him or compensate him in any way.

I process these types of actions and for the first offense SM is to be flagged a U and is counseled- 2nd offense it states SM loses security clearance and begins adverse separation. 

how long does this flag stay on if Soldier doesn’t have a repeat offense? Will this stay on the Soldiers record permanently? (I have 2 Soldiers, both new E-4s)

Thanks

Basically, the title...

Insurance costs is the biggest factor in my decision with joining the reserves.

Currently active duty and I'm trying to figure out whether to ETS or go reserves based on health insurance costs for my family (3 Kids, 1 Spouse, 1 income HH). 

I have 2 options ETS with disability (unfortunately broken) or go reserve to keep the health benefits. Yes, I know it has a deductible, out of pocket max, co pay. etc. But compared to the civilian world, companies offering health insurance (example) with 5k deductible and 20k out of pocket max all while still having a high co pay is loads cheaper. Realistically, that would kill our savings in a couple years. My family is blessed to be all healthy (rarely visit doctor) but as we all know anything can happen.

Not worried about myself too much as I expect to use my VA health benefits if ETS. So, to Reserves or to ETS? WWYD? Also, in case you're wondering I shaved before typing this. (PM for pic)

,Army,"What is something you believe to be an unspoken ugly truth of the army?

I have my own, but others experiences may contradict what I believe. If you disagree, feel free to explain why.

My truths:
1. If you are single and unmarried, none of your problems matter and they're all your own fault. In the eyes of leadership, it's always something you did wrong. You didn't budget, you didn't reach out for help, you didn't ask anyone, you didn't do the proper paperwork, you didn't go through your COC, etc. Leadership will always find a way to make a single unmarried soldier's problems their fault. It often starts with direct lower level leadership, i.e. direct NCO and up. ""You should have known what you were signing up for.""

2. Soldiers wanting to commit suicide are often overlooked because people expect it to be the highly exaggerated examples in training. In reality, most Soldiers that are suicidal are, in their minds, making it obvious, but most people don't realize that that's what they're doing. Most people perceive a suicidal soldier as ""going through a rough patch."" Or they think that because they're laughing and joking about their problems that they're coping fine. In my opinion, when someone jokes about their problems, that's their way of crying out for help. Even when you confront them, they're going to lie and say they're good. But they're not.

&lt;p&gt;I have my own, but others experiences may contradict what I believe. If you disagree, feel free to explain why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My truths:
1. If you are single and unmarried, none of your problems matter and they&amp;#39;re all your own fault. In the eyes of leadership, it&amp;#39;s always something you did wrong. You didn&amp;#39;t budget, you didn&amp;#39;t reach out for help, you didn&amp;#39;t ask anyone, you didn&amp;#39;t do the proper paperwork, you didn&amp;#39;t go through your COC, etc. Leadership will always find a way to make a single unmarried soldier&amp;#39;s problems their fault. It often starts with direct lower level leadership, i.e. direct NCO and up. &amp;quot;You should have known what you were signing up for.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soldiers wanting to commit suicide are often overlooked because people expect it to be the highly exaggerated examples in training. In reality, most Soldiers that are suicidal are, in their minds, making it obvious, but most people don&amp;#39;t realize that that&amp;#39;s what they&amp;#39;re doing. Most people perceive a suicidal soldier as &amp;quot;going through a rough patch.&amp;quot; Or they think that because they&amp;#39;re laughing and joking about their problems that they&amp;#39;re coping fine. In my opinion, when someone jokes about their problems, that&amp;#39;s their way of crying out for help. Even when you confront them, they&amp;#39;re going to lie and say they&amp;#39;re good. But they&amp;#39;re not.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, these are my own observations. If you disagree, I&amp;#39;d like to hear why, but just be respectful about it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"So I got sent a 223 page PDF going over the results of my claims and med board in general for the first part of the process. I have 5 calendar days, which ends tomorrow, to dispute the results.

I don't think they expect soldiers to read that pdf considering it's so long. I have found probably near/over 100 inconsistencies after reading nearly every page at this point. Blatant fabrication, typos/lies depending on the page(more info can be provided if asked; I find it difficult to explain), and things that are just literally wrong. For example, a ROM test for my hips when I didn't claim hip problems, and no ROM test for my hips were done, because I didn't claim it. Because I don't have hip problems. But numbers for my hips are present somehow. For almost every finding they have. If I had to give it a percentage I'd throw around 70-80% of this PDF seems to have inconsistencies. There are findings I definitely agree with for sure however.

Do I fight this? How would I even start. Are there other routes other than my PEBLO if need be? I understand I have 1 year after I get out to rectify inconsistencies, but nearly the entire thing is inconsistent. Even down to them claiming I don't take medicine for my disqualifying condition. With documents supporting that I do. In the same pdf, and occasionally in the same page.

None of this is speculation. I can prove that something is very wrong in the pdf they provided me.

Is this a common occurrence with a board that you've heard where nearly everything is wrong and can easily be proven so? Am I overthinking this? I am willing and able to say I could potentially be misreading information, I'm not a doctor, but some of what I'm reading is legitimately wrong.

I don't want to underplay what I mean by inconsistencies either. Some of the documents for example say I don't take medicine for my disqualifying condition multiple times. But my medical records prove I am taking this medicine. That doesn't seem like a standard typo.

If examples of inconsistencies, either minor or not, want to be provided if asked I can do that in the comments below.

,Army,"I requested Germany as my next PCS, and it will most likely get approved since I added three more years to my contract just to get Germany. I choose Germany mainly because I want to travel throughout Europe while I am there and just see and experience that part of the world. However, how naive of me that I never considered racism as a potential issue as part of my research about Europe before I submitted my PCS request. Now that I have done quite some research in this regard, I feel like I have shot myself in the foot with this decision. And I don't think there is anything I can do to change it before the order comes down, which just makes it worse. 

Some background for the context. I am ethnically East Asian, 6' 185 lbs, and physically fit. I have never really experienced racism in the U.S. growing up. At least not straight to my face with racial slurs that kind of racism. However, based on my research, non-whites experience way more racism in Germany and in Europe in general than compared to North America (I traveled extensively in the U.S. and Canada). I mainly researched people's experiences in Germany and Europe on Reddit, Quora, and YouTube. The majority of the anecdotes that I have read mentioned being called racial slurs straight to their faces while walking on the street just minding their own business. Other incidents included being refused service at restaurants or other social services, one mentioned being spit on the foot while waiting for his train in Germany, and the difference in attitudes while interacting with locals. All these are from European-born racial minorities, expats, and tourists. When I narrowed the research down to ""How Asians are treated in Germany and other European countries?"" what came up the most was being called racial slurs straight to the face.

I understand racism is an issue that exists in every country. However, I am just shocked that it is seemingly so prevalent in Germany and other European countries. If a particular issue is brought up frequently enough (not by the locals but by foreigners in a country), that means it is a common enough occurrence that bothers people. 

I think my expectations for Europe were extremely high and looking into how non-whites are being treated shocked me as I have never experienced those kinds of racism here in the U.S. And I just don't want incidents like these to ruin my experience in Germany and Europe as I will certainly travel the continent before coming back home.

I want to see if anyone can provide some insights into your experience in Germany and traveling the European continent because I couldn't really find that many U.S. service members' experience on this particular issue. I genuinely want to know and learn so as to get myself into the right mindset and expectations before going to Germany. Please don't be nasty in this post.

,Army,"Hey yall. Michigan army national guard here. im looking for some advice on how to handle the dramatics in the military. Im positive its not just in the NG so anybodys advice would be greatly appreciated❤️.
A little background about me: I grew up an army brat. My mom retired as a cw 3 after 23 years of flying hawks for 160th (soar). She was big on teaching me about the army. She implemented army style teachings like dicipline and honor. Ive been getting dropped and smoked since i could do a push up lol. 
I know for me, living my life by army values is easy as its second nature by now. Like how people put faith into their religion, i put my faith into the army. I always thought it was a place to hone leadership skills, communication skills, teamwork skills, just generally become a better human. 
Recently, ive been struggling with the fact that the national guard is nothing like that. The general idea that complacency, gossip, and the general mistreatment of soldiers in my unit has been getting to me lately, and i feel like im losing my faith. Rumors spread like wildfire, and when ive brought the ones about me up to my leadership, ive been told to just ignore them. Usually, i can do it, but my last straw was when my new plt sgt told me he had heard things about me before even meeting me, and the rumors were about my sex life. Like i said, i can usually brush things off my shoulders, but when my personal life is outed, and thats what shapes my reputation, i really struggle to just ignore it. 
I used to love the military and everything it stood for and now i dont even want to apply myself. I hate going to drill. I feel like i cant trust anyone. I generally feel very alone when im around members of my unit and i feel like no one there will back me. Ldrship will just tell me to ignore everything and people will just keep gossiping.

,Army,"I’ll be vague on some of the details as I do like my anonymity. I’ve been a part of r/army for quite some time (pretty sure this is my third account ). I usually leverage the sub to stay informed on things going on across the Army at the sub-surface level.    


Some years back I was afforded the opportunity to lead Soldiers. Within the formation was one of the brightest, motivated, and most exceptional Soldiers I’d come across. There was no doubt he was the best Soldier in the formation. He routinely competed for every competition at every echelon he could, he was technically competent to boot, and had a great personality. This Soldier was a few totem poles below me in the CoC. I recognized him and his Soldiers often and his leadership threw everything they could their way (missions, training events, etc) - you know the old adage great work only gets you more work.    


I thought because this Soldier was performing so well, and in turn leading his Soldiers to perform well, while being recognized and afforded some good opportunities that he was enjoying his time in the formation. Man, that couldn’t have been further from the truth.    


 I never stopped to think about what this particular Soldier wanted or needed to continue being happy with his job/life and not get burned out. As a leader you understand the 80/20 rule but things just kind happen over time that you lose sight over the minutiae and it’s hard to act on things you don’t know (you don’t know what you don’t know).    


This is where this sub helped re-energize my lapse in effective leadership. As I was scrolling through one of the threads I saw a simple comment from a user about how his PSG was incompetent and how he was struggling to find motivation. In short he perceived other personnel were getting the sexier missions, deployments, and his leadership wasn’t helping him get to his NCOPD course he needed for promotion. I clicked on the profile and saw other similar comments. The uniqueness about my unit for things such as deployments and other descriptors gave me a hunch that “oh shit this is one of my guys, in fact it’s my best guy!”.    


I could’ve been an asshole about this or felt embarrassed my unit was anonymously being put on blast but those thoughts never crossed my mind. Instead I was humbled and disappointed that I wasn’t an effective enough leader to prevent this sort of thing. Things were going great for me, on the outside looking in my formation was the best, #1 etc. What a failure, I thought. So I PMd him.    


Without hesitation I sent him a note and apologized for not being aware of his issues and that I will personally make sure he gets to his school while doing everything in my power to get him on the next combat rotation (this could’ve been foolish if he wasn’t who I thought he was). Work came the next day and I called him in for a chat. He let loose about things occurring in his foxhole that I hadn’t even noticed.    


Not even a couple months later I had to remove his leadership for bad personal conduct. I changed out shortly after setting things in motion to make that Soldier’s life better. The Soldier got the deployment he wanted and was sent to school upon returning from deployment. After PCSing, him and his new leadership reached out with a simple thanks and that Soldier was, for a lack of better words,  “living his best life”. He was a little embarrassed that I found his Reddit profile. He only posted sporadically since then and not in this sub - I feel bad about that.    


I owe this simple good news story to this sub. There are much bigger good news stories as a result of this place but this is a personal one that’s near and dear to me because it’s shaped my outlook on the social media space for good.    


As an aside, awhile back I had an interview for a selective opportunity and they asked me “how do you get feedback that systems and processes in the Army are working”. I told them that I’ll sometimes browse media sites such as Reddit and the interviewers looked at me like I just grew a dick on my forehead.

&lt;p&gt;Not even a couple months later I had to remove his leadership for bad personal conduct. I changed out shortly after setting things in motion to make that Soldier’s life better. The Soldier got the deployment he wanted and was sent to school upon returning from deployment. After PCSing, him and his new leadership reached out with a simple thanks and that Soldier was, for a lack of better words,  “living his best life”. He was a little embarrassed that I found his Reddit profile. He only posted sporadically since then and not in this sub - I feel bad about that.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I owe this simple good news story to this sub. There are much bigger good news stories as a result of this place but this is a personal one that’s near and dear to me because it’s shaped my outlook on the social media space for good.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aside, awhile back I had an interview for a selective opportunity and they asked me “how do you get feedback that systems and processes in the Army are working”. I told them that I’ll sometimes browse media sites such as Reddit and the interviewers looked at me like I just grew a dick on my forehead. So for my wendy’s order I’ll just have a frosty.&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"I had to lead a 12B platoon with this guy 2011-2012. He was 5'3"" and weighed 215 lbs and looked like a bald, Hispanic humanoid beachball. He couldn't run, couldn't ruck, was as dumb as bricks, could only read and write at a 3rd grade level, and would brazenly steal snacks and smokes from our Joes. He also once cussed them all out in formation, blaming them for the fact that he didn't get picked up for E8.

This guy ended up landing a cushy GS job post-Army...but now (per LinkedIn) it looks like he's unemployed.

What about you? Who was your worst platoon sergeant and what did he do to earn that distinction?

He was 5&amp;#39;3&amp;quot; and weighed 215 lbs and looked like a bald, Hispanic humanoid beachball. He couldn&amp;#39;t run, couldn&amp;#39;t ruck, was as dumb as bricks, could only read and write at a 3rd grade level, and would brazenly steal snacks and smokes from our Joes. He also once cussed them all out in formation, blaming them for the fact that he didn&amp;#39;t get picked up for E8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy ended up landing a cushy GS job post-Army...but now (per LinkedIn) it looks like he&amp;#39;s unemployed.&lt;/p&gt;

WRONG! These mothefuckers are bringing in AAMs from 2009. Getting duty positions and dates corrected from 2015. NCOERs uploaded from 2018.

Then they have the audacity to rush my ass and demand that I drop everything that I'm doing so they can get their shit uploaded and corrected (which by the way, through ippsa can take hours to correct assignment history, cross referencing dates of NCOERs, dates on orders, etc.)

,Army," 

Hello everyone, I am a bit struggling to make a decision on whether I should join the army as enlisted or officer. I am currently 23 years old and I just completed my mandatory military duty in South Korea in March 2023 (I have dual citizenship: Korea and the US). Now I am back in the United States and continuing my 3rd year of 5-year architecture program as an undergraduate student. During my academic, I had a strong passion for the US Army and I made a decision to walk the Army path(hopefully serve more than 20 years). I made two options and I am struggling to choose one. Please let me know what you guys think about each option.

1. Our campus has 2 year ROTC program. If I choose this, I'll go ROTC Leadership Training Camp at Fort Knox, Kentucky during the summer break and do the ROTC program in my 4th and 5th year of college. Once again, I want to serve in the army for at least 20 years and would it be difficult to maintain the officer position? I heard if you don't get promoted for a specific amount of time, you will have to leave the army.
2. After completing 3rd year of college, I'll join as a reserved soldier and complete my academic. Unfortunately, the architecture program does not provide online classes so I chose reserved rather than active duty. However, I am going to make an attempt to switch from reserved duty to active duty right after getting the degree. After serving as an enlisted soldier for 7\~8 years, I'll apply for OCS or green to gold to become an officer.

I think I am just overthinking it too of future stuff, but I want to make a firm decision very soon so that I can be confident about the choices that I make. My main goal is to become an officer in the future. What are your guys' thoughts?

,Army,"Keeping things vague. Our preschooler attended school on base. 

FAPM and CDC director called my spouse and I in for a meeting. Stated no one was hurt, but an urgent decision had to made that day. Okay. I tried to push up the meeting, they wouldn't meet even an hour earlier. 

FAPM started the meeting saying it was not to be recorded. Okay. We're not army, different branch here for a joint forces thing.

FAPM started by stating the above facts, but the person who did this was under the age of culpability. So good news, no crime has been committed! Therefore there's no police report. 

They would not tell us how these events were ""caught"" other than video existed of it. They would not turn over the video to CID when pressed. 

FAPM stated it might be a good idea to get a regular check up by the pediatrician on base, but no forensic interview or forensic physical was required because again (!) No crime has occurred. That it would likely be traumatic to our child. I said fuck that out loud, and that the base clinic would not be touching our kid. We switched to select during open enrollment anyway. 

FAPM &amp; CDC director explained the delay in notifying us was due to coming up with a safety plan: the truely responsible party was a piece of furniture that partially obscured the view of the teacher. It had been properly reprimanded by being moved. They also decided to move our son to the other side of the classroom. 

The ""exhibiting child"" was not removed from the CDC. The CDC director said they would still have some shared activities together. 

I asked how she could possibly say our son wasn't internally injured? We argued. 

FAPM didn't hand us a damn thing. I asked where are the papers? You're supposed to be handing us an entire folder right now. FAPM stated ""people would call us"". And that if no one called us in 24hrs, then to reach out directly to her, and she'd ""nudge them"".

She gave us no one to follow up with other than her, and also, didn't even give us her office # or card.

I said fuck that and drove our kid to closest children's hospital. A forensic exam revealed a lot more. 

We are unsure who's command we were under in our branch for this deployment. It took a considerable amount of time. we were busy addressing medical need. Our son is in fact injured internally. He's also clearly traumatized and freaking out. We're obviously out of childcare and drowning. Full blown crisis. 

I discovered;
-FAPM notified our command but did not tell them any details. Not our names or contact info, nor any details. Simply stated there was an instance of PBS involving a child of that branch/command. 
-did the same thing for our jag
-did the same thing for CID
-did the same thing for cps

Facts:
-CDC &amp; FAPM delayed notifying us by 30 hrs. So there were 3-4 (which is it?) events, a total of 78hrs prior first event. Maybe? They would not give exact dates, duration, or times. 
-dna is not really collectable beyond 24hrs for the kit. Technically possible at 72 hrs, but diminishing returns. 
-CDC didn't create an incident report form. We've hounded them. They will not provide one.
-FAPM did not notify garrison police
-CID argued with us for hours. Wouldn't take a report or statement from us, nor open an investigation into negligence on behalf of staff. Would not view or retain footage. 
-I sent an email to the garrison commander. Initially they called, sounded cooperative but hands off. Kept directing us back to FAPM and CID. Then they stopped responding. Straight to voicemail, everything goes unresponded. 


I finally tracked down each person FAPM notified. Verified in writing if protocol required 24hrs to notify, she waited 23hrs and 47 minutes. I forced a CID to open an investigation by notifying CPS through the Children's hospital. 

Good news, they found another impacted child. Bad news, we've been shut out of everything. 

They also went on the offensive. Garrison commander banned me from CDC property under punishment of 6 months in prison. CDC director is stating I threatened the staff. I most certainly did not. I went in and asked for the incident report. They told me no and to leave, I complied immediately although I was pissed. No threatening movements. GPS shows I was on base for all of 9 minutes. I also popped in to run an errand across the street, have proof.

Our child is making repeated statements of adult involvement. But he's also 4. I've read Miller vs. United States. His testimony would be ""unreliable"".

I have a 1 degree connection to the military desk at CNN. I put out feelers, there's a couple news outlets interested but only if our identity is revealed. Spouse would have to do it. 

Im realistic. I know we're not getting justice. I've read DoDI 6400.01, 608-18. If we go to media I can see the protocol requiring to kick it up outside the chain of command and automatically trigger a whole lot of scrutiny.

,Army,"Dear SMA,

How to fix the army in a few easy steps:

1) get your head out of your butt

2) hire me. I'm currently working on my Master's to be a therapist, so I know how to listen. 

3) pay me $50k and send me around the country (and OCONUS) for a year. I'll go base to base in birkenstocks and shorts and take soldiers out for lunch—the normal guys. The terminal E4, the PFC struggling but *trying* to pass their H/W, the SSG whose brother died and yet the SSG can't go home for the funeral because leadership said so. Give me a budget of $40 x working day to buy these dudes lunch and hear what's going on in their life

4) I'll take detailed notes, and at the end of the year we will synthesize all the information and create a weekend/weeklong course for senior leadership. 

5) we take a number of groups of senior leadership through this course about how to deal with soldier issues in ""the new army"", starting with not denying emergency leave just because we need the soldier ""just in case""

,Army,"So I need some advice because no one in my unit really wants to help me with medical issues that I'm having. I've been diagnosed with chronic anxiety which just showed up out of nowhere before annual training last year and I knew there was nothing to be worried about but it still happened. I've turned in medical records for all of that. I also developed gastroesophical reflux disease (GERD) along with chronic IBS and chronic gastritis which causes me severe stomach pain especially when I'm stressed. My COC knows about all of this and it has been sent in writing along with documentation from doctors that is signed. I have a pending medical profile but I still have people (especially my PSG) saying that since I'm not technically on profile yet that nothing will happen to help me with this since they cannot cover their own a**es. The commander had previously agreed in November to let me RST because the chaos during a weekend at my unit stresses me TF out to the point that I'm in extreme physical pain and cannot sleep at night before and during. I know this seems quite extreme over a drill weekend and I don't understand myself why I'm having these issues but it is what it is I guess. Anyways, I get word 3 days ago that I had to be at drill this weekend from my PSG and it was per the 1SG so I had conflicting information (in my eyes) from the commander and 1SG. I reached out to the full-time staff because I had to go to my unit and get a new CAC as mine was about to expire so I didn't think anything of it and I went to S1 who is actually super helpful and asked about this. I was told to call back that afternoon after she had her meeting with the commander and I did when our S3 sergeant answered the phone and was an absolute smart a** and was like we will see you Saturday. Anyways, I then proceeded to get extremely stressed and got sick so I went to the doctor and got a medical excuse. I sent that in only to get crawled about ignoring COC and that I must fulfill my duties to the army reserves. I was told that I would be excused from drill but would not be able to make it up when I know of another person in my platoon that was allowed to RST this weekend. I'm kind of at a standstill right now because all of my medical conditions which are chronic are being ignored and I don't know how to get this situation handled. I can't go up the COC because my unit will not allow anyone to know how to get in contact with anyone above them in order to get things corrected. There was another soldier who had an injury during an FTX and filed two congressional complaints after the unit did not compensate him for his injury or get him medical care and still nothing was done to help him or compensate him in any way. The only reason I add that is because it just goes to show the unit has a track record for ignoring medical for soldiers.

I also developed gastroesophical reflux disease (GERD) along with chronic IBS and chronic gastritis which causes me severe stomach pain especially when I&amp;#39;m stressed. My COC knows about all of this and it has been sent in writing along with documentation from doctors that is signed. I have a pending medical profile but I still have people (especially my PSG) saying that since I&amp;#39;m not technically on profile yet that nothing will happen to help me with this since they cannot cover their own a&lt;strong&gt;es. The commander had previously agreed in November to let me RST because the chaos during a weekend at my unit stresses me TF out to the point that I&amp;#39;m in extreme physical pain and cannot sleep at night before and during. I know this seems quite extreme over a drill weekend and I don&amp;#39;t understand myself why I&amp;#39;m having these issues but it is what it is I guess. Anyways, I get word 3 days ago that I had to be at drill this weekend from my PSG and it was per the 1SG so I had conflicting information (in my eyes) from the commander and 1SG. I reached out to the full-time staff because I had to go to my unit and get a new CAC as mine was about to expire so I didn&amp;#39;t think anything of it and I went to S1 who is actually super helpful and asked about this. I was told to call back that afternoon after she had her meeting with the commander and I did when our S3 sergeant answered the phone and was an absolute smart a&lt;/strong&gt; and was like we will see you Saturday. Anyways, I then proceeded to get extremely stressed and got sick so I went to the doctor and got a medical excuse. I sent that in only to get crawled about ignoring COC and that I must fulfill my duties to the army reserves. I was told that I would be excused from drill but would not be able to make it up when I know of another person in my platoon that was allowed to RST this weekend. I&amp;#39;m kind of at a standstill right now because all of my medical conditions which are chronic are being ignored and I don&amp;#39;t know how to get this situation handled. I can&amp;#39;t go up the COC because my unit will not allow anyone to know how to get in contact with anyone above them in order to get things corrected. There was another soldier who had an injury during an FTX and filed two congressional complaints after the unit did not compensate him for his injury or get him medical care and still nothing was done to help him or compensate him in any way. The only reason I add that is because it just goes to show the unit has a track record for ignoring medical for soldiers. What should I do at this point?&lt;/p&gt;

,Army,"Hi all, 

I process these types of actions and for the first offense SM is to be flagged a U and is counseled- 2nd offense it states SM loses security clearance and begins adverse separation. 

how long does this flag stay on if Soldier doesn’t have a repeat offense? Will this stay on the Soldiers record permanently? (I have 2 Soldiers, both new E-4s)

Thanks

,Army,"Hello,

I am an immigrant(34) who have served my country ( since I am a green card holder, I would still call  the country I am from home country) 

To be a soldier has been my lifelong dream.

I was infantry man  while serving my country back then. but they only asked me do general labor job which you can easily find at the construction site. As long as I remember, I shot 20 rnds throughout my service.(active duty)


Currently, I am working for the company I love and they let me work 100% remote etc.

However, I have this strong calling and unfilled feeling that my time is almost out for serving this soon to be my country. I am a person who love the saying “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country”. 

So, I am seriously thinking about enlisting as 11b.

But the problem is I can only assume what infantry life in the us army is like. (By watching youtube videos etc)

Also, I am afraid that there might be language barrier since I am a non native English speaker. 
At this point I am thinking army as a lifelong career. Even though I am working for the descent company, I am still struggling with english.

So my questions are as below.



Question 1) will I do general labor things like cleaning, cutting trees rather than shooting machine guns or repelling from black-hawks or do cqb things? What would I do as an infantry man in the army??


Question 2)
Anyone have seen non english speakers in ranger selection program( not ranger school) or 18x q course?


Question 3)
I really want to experience as much as possible and willing to go through various army schools.( jungle warfare, sere, airborne etc)
Is it easy to apply for those schools as an infantryman in the unit? From my understanding and assumption, it is totally up to chain of command and luck.

,Army,"I have the solution for every current problem in the army.
be it retention, recruitment, morale, mold or toxic leadership.
I have thought long and hard and have come up with what's called an SA.
Or as its more known by its informal name: Semen analysis.
now hold on before you guys skip away (mods please don't delete this post for the sake of the future of the us army).
This will be just the same as a UA only with a few improvements.
instead of a single observer your whole company will get together on this special occasion and will observe you honorably discharge your ""sample"".
Now this will foster a environment of strong morale and understanding among not only enlisted but officers also.
imagine your whole company standing at attention looking at you in awe as you exert yourself for the greatest military force on this planet.
I have plans in motion to also implement this at a divisional level but sadly some 3 stars don't want to know what a good time is.
this whole procedure is ofcourse only for men, the women can figure something out for themselves.
After the implementation of SA's the new generation will rush to the nearest recruitment  office frantically jumping up and down to be part of this new wonderful army.
For some reason the mold in the barracks will also dissappear but I haven't really looked into that.
As for the gents who need more information about this whole ordeal you can visit my desk located at the Southern slope of Mount Bona, Look for the man with a black beard.

,Army,"Howdy Ladies and Gents,

Here's a long one for backstory, to aid in any answers or insight you can give. Since none of my military buddies from childhood are amongst the living, you're my next available people to ask/talk to. ASVAB score: 98; Physicals passed, doctor's note of concern for left labrum- in therapy to improve it; all that's left is for me to approach for the formal contract. Been told to consider waiting for the Recruiters that pass through Medical Schools for Army Doctor route.

TLDR for basic answers/ smartass observations: looking to join 18X. Is this a good route to go? What are your experiences with the new path into Rangers/ SF, versus 'earning' Your way into the ranks, via traditional route?

I'm close to signing up- holding off to get my physical conditioning up to speed, and make absolutely sure that I am not seeing myself up for failure- been in contact with the recruiter, who has admitted he cannot answer my question(s) past this point- so, I'm here to get roped apart like I was in residency, but might as well ask those who are more experienced. 

I'm 28, male, with some serious FOMO. I know something about to happen- but not sure what/when- but I want in. Previous medical industry background, so I have some skills ready to offer and/or sharpen up on. Former competitive long range shooter, so I'm familiar with weapon systems and how to shoot with precision- otherwise, I understand that I'm signing up to be the biggest dumbass in the room/ ranks, so there's a LOT for me to learn. Not sure if the correct mindset to have is that I have skills to offer, and at least an 'abbreviated' start into learning how to fill an appropriate role- or, if it's better to go in thinking that I know nothing and will be taught what they want me to know?

All of that said, despite medical school, I would rather go in to break stuff up front- or help in immediate traumas- than to stay in the back and handle what I would as a civilian. So, to avoid the latter, would the army even let me do so? What should I do going in? Could I go from 18X and into (what I understand) is the Delta designation, for field medic? Could I maintain that training/ designation, and still have a chance to actually operate- or would I be kept on a leash (already have a dark sense of humor, and a 'Quit fucking talking about it and just get it done' attitude/ tempered fuse) by those around me so that I'd just be readily available to apply medical aide? 

My current college hours would put me at an E4 rank, with E5 probably being attained by graduation from the 8 month basic/school graduation and into selection (per the recruiter), so from there- what does it take to actually get selected? I have the physical ability and mental tenacity to accomplish whatever I'd need to- but, as the old adage goes, you can go fast alone or far as a team- so, knowing that the higher tiered teams choose their members off of more than operational capability, what do they look for in an individual? Do my current mindsets communicate toxicity or liability to you, or am I just inexperienced?

How would jump school treat me, now that I'm older? My buddies all went through it at 19, and halfway hungover (old school, unsure if that's still skateable), but now- what's it like as an older guy?

Should I not pass selection, what would the 18X contract have me doing- is it similar to signing up for BUD/S and washing out so you end up cleaning toilets in a ship for 6 years? Am I forced into another designation, or basic regiment? 

And finally, for fun, what are the odds of sneaking some copenhagen or grizzly in?😂 what are some tips to actually help me succeed in maxing out my potential, or just pissing off the DI for fun?

,Army,"I’m coming here first before google, just to see if anyone has had experience with this. Long story short, I need to break my lease exactly one month earlier than what I signed on our contract. I just want to have all the facts and my ducks in a row to prevent making a fool of myself.

,Army,Hi I’m an e4 that doesn’t agreed with a negative counseling because the e5 wrote a lie in it. The nco wrote a false statement in which he said “ Spc was disrespectful” and negativity counseled me. I disagree and wrote my remarks.

,Army,"Im in college, with a gf. Not active duty.

I've got like 2 years to go on my contract, but life is just very overwhelming right now between school, financial situations, gf's family health problems (her dad just diagnosed with stage 4 cancer), my own family health and financial problems, just moved, new job, etc

I don't know what to do but I dont want to deploy until all this stuff is situated because if I leave I would risk my mother having huge problems even putting food on the table or paying rent.

To say I am now severely anxious and depressed is an understatement, my gf and I have literally lost sleep. I have had psychiatric issues in the past but have been pretty good in the past few years where I don't even need therapy anymore. I think I'm there.

The anxiety and pressure ive been under -- I cant even focus on school anymore, I start reading and then just start thinking of how fucked everything would be if I deploy after reading like two lines of my textbook, similarly if im watching a study video, like ADD kinda? I just cant even focus on shit.

I think the army isn't for me anymore, my outlook has majorly changed since i first joined, yet also, I have a lil ego and think I'm being a bit of a pussy in a way. However, if you guys saw how stacked my life is with life events rn I don't think I'd be alone soi im torn with my own emotions

My unit's leadership has been silent, I'm talking I contacted the commander, XO, S3, etc. so they all say they cant do anything anymore. The problems is they already moved me to the other unit, like they singled me out to deploy because of my mos and other unit needed one of my mos and I got fucked becuase there's only like 2 deployable soldiers of the mos I have in my unit, and I'm one of the two.

I have no point of contact with the receiving deploying unit they have not contacted me yet

I want to maintain opsec but were not immediately deploying, its gonna be more than a few months

I am worried with my current state that any deployment at all would be life changing not for the best.

,Army,"I'm at a loss here, not sure what to do.

I am ETS'ing soon and I'm trying to move out of my apartment on 1 February. At the beginning of this month, I delivered my orders and a notice to vacate to the property management company out here in Clarksville TN.

They told me I wasn't covered under SCRA because I am ETSing and ETS orders are not legally a PCS order. After reading online, speaking to JAG on campbell, I figured out that is in fact NOT true. JAG wrote me a ""letter of demand"" basically requesting my property management company to comply with federal law and it outlines the SCRA, the JTR the SCRA refers to, and how the JTR defines ETS'ing, separation and retirement orders as PCS orders.

I delivered that letter from JAG to the company on Friday, the 5th of January. They were condescending when I delivered them the letter, but once they read the letterhead, they shat a brick and got very nervous towards the end of my conversation with them. They specifically said they have NEVER followed SCRA for anyone ETSing out of the military. They told me they're going to pass that letter along to their lawyer and I should receive a phone call sometime this week. That never happened.

Now, I'm just wondering how I should go about this. I am planning on stopping by their office at 0900 On monday/tuesday and following up with this whole debacle. (depending if they're open on monday considering the holiday). Beyond that, I have no idea how to proceed. The Legal Officer (Outstanding individual by the way) is now at JRTC.

However, I recently looked at my credit report and it says I have a debt collection case open from Spectrum’s debt collection agency Ch 11 Communications and it took down a huge chunk of my credit score. 

I called up Spectrum trying to figure out what happened because they never reached out to me once about any outstanding balance. Their billing and collection department said my profile had zero outstanding balance, but that they could not talk to the debt collection agency—instead I need to talk to them and show them my zero balance invoice/receipt.
