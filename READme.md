# Classification Model for Reddit Posts Using NLP

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a classification model that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to accurately categorize Reddit posts into specific subreddits. The primary focus is on military-related subreddits such as 'army' and 'usmc', along with mental health-related subreddits like 'schizophrenic' and 'bipolar'.

### Goal

The primary objective is to create an advanced model capable of analyzing and classifying posts with high accuracy, ensuring that each post is appropriately categorized even when presented with closely related category options.
The secondary goal is to understand the morale/sentiment among 'usmc' and 'army' subreddit members and to gauge the general state of the armed forces. Additionally, a comparative analysis of sentiment in 'schizophrenic' vs 'bipolar' subreddits will be conducted.

## Data Science Process

### 1. Problem Statement

- Define the need for a classification model and its relevance in understanding subreddit dynamics.
- Discuss the significance of sentiment analysis in this context.

### 2. Data Collection

- Describe the process of gathering data from Reddit using APIs.
- Mention the specific subreddits targeted: 'army', 'usmc', 'schizophrenic', and 'bipolar'.

### 3. Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Outline steps taken for cleaning the data.
- Present initial findings from the EDA, focusing on patterns and anomalies.

### 4. Preprocessing & Modeling

- Discuss the NLP techniques used for data preprocessing.
- Describe the modeling approach and algorithms considered for the classification task.

### 5. Evaluation and Conceptual Understanding

- Explain the metrics used to evaluate the model's performance.
- Discuss the model's ability to accurately classify posts into the respective subreddits.

### 6. Conclusion and Recommendations

- Summarize key findings.
- Provide recommendations based on the study's outcomes.

## Sentiment Analysis

- Detail the methodology used for sentiment analysis on each subreddit.
- Compare and contrast sentiments between grouped subreddits ('army' vs 'usmc' and 'schizophrenic' vs 'bipolar').

## Word Cloud Generation

- Describe the process of creating word clouds for each subreddit.
- Analyze the word clouds to infer dominant themes and sentiments.

## Final Thoughts

- Reflect on the implications of the findings for understanding the morale within the 'army' and 'usmc' communities.
- Discuss the broader impact of sentiment analysis in understanding online communities.
