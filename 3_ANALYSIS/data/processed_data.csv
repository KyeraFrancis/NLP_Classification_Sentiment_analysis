I dropped a CAD packet and it got approved. Am now waiting to get scrolled. I spoke to a Captain who will receive my scroll and cut my orders. She advised she has duty stations in Korea, Hood, and Bliss.

From my time spent lurking, Hood sounds like a mess so if I get to choose, I'll avoid it. Bliss sounds better but not by a whole lot. Korea sounds like the way to go.

The sticking point is promotion boards. If I get in early 2024, I'll be just 4 months or so from O-3. She expressed some hesitation on sending me to Korea with my promotion so close. 

I can guess at why but I don't understand enough about this process to understand it. Why couldn't I just promote in Korea? Why would promoting stateside be an easier process?

She said she could delay my promotion by 18mo but given the pay difference that sounds like a major L.

Army,"I'm summoning those of you who are *only* **currently active duty** or **retired**. 

This is about a topic of a veteran wanting to go back in, active duty and looking for your outtake.

The reason why I'm seeking opinions only from active duty or retired veterans is because there are too many biased opinions of us veterans when the topic is brought up about *going back into the military*. Yeah, I get it, going back in, is a stupid idea - to you? I get it, ok. But I already heard your reasons, let me hear it from the updated/current sources that knows what the fuck is going on, right now.

So. I'm a veteran. I wanna go back into the military, as an officer. I did four years in the military, enlisted,, infantry (3 combat tours), got out, went to school using my GI bill and got my degree. The main goal prior to me even getting out, was to go to school, get my degree and go back in as an officer. I started contracting overseas as soon as I got out and did my schooling online. Made bank. The whole money chase is over for me, I made great fucking money high six figures but it didn't bring me happiness. Job felt missionless/empty. Along the way, met many veterans talk about VA VA VA VA. Did my VA shit, slightly forgetting the idea of going back in and only claimed minimal stuff. I have 30% disability now with a possible option for a higher rating (if i claim more, I only claimed my knees). I've been out for some time now, about 5 years now going on 6. I'm fit and live an active life style. I am now in a job doing what I got a degree in. This idea of going back in has stuck with me and even working with the military now but the AF, I still can think of myself going back in. (Side note: I can't ask this question to the military I work with right now, AF, because these mf'ers are a different breed. Gauges, beards, get off early, don't police call - just a different fucking bread) and I get it. Times are different now. Whatever, merry christmas, doesn't phase me. I just can't ask this question because the AF lifestyle is fucking different and I'm not looking to join the AF. I already tried :). Fun fact, if you've been out for 5 years, you can't ever enlist. Second fun fact, going officer in the AF is a min 2 year wait. And they are fucking selective on who they choose. I'm not that god damn smart. I wasn't stellar in college, I did enough to get my fucking degree. And they base their selection on additional shit like voulenteer time and other side shit. Gotta pass. Anyway back to my story. The idea of going back in has stuck with me pretty much since getting out. I do like the military lifestyle, I like being on base, I like all aspects of the military. The purpose of my goal here, is because I want a retirement. I've met countless veterans while contracting overseas who were retired, getting their retirement checks, and VA, plus the check for work. I always envied that. I don't want to retire in the US. Thats my point. Sure, VA is nice if you get a high rating but when it comes time for me to retire. I don't wanna HAVE to work if I don't need to. Having 2 guaranteed paychecks, plus if I retire as a civ somewhere, so 3, and when I get to the age for social securtity, thats 4 checks, sure as hell sounds a lot better than just 1 (VA) or 2 (VA) and a (CIV) job and then later SS. Plus the VA never really has anything saying the VA the VA is forever or at least I dont know if it exists, I cant find it, and with the amount of veterans getting out on a daily basis and claiming VA, getting 100%, fuck I don't even know what the system is going to look like in the next 10 years. I would hate to be relying soley on that and then it ends up stopping or some shit. Thats scary. I'm okay with the current changes the military has shifted to. I've been out long enough,, and worked in enough enviorments that Im well adjusted. To be nice. I'm not a hard ass; knife hander, all that shit. But I am about the military - I like the lifestyle, fitness standards of having to PT every fucking day, I like the idea of moving around consistently, while having a job for stability. The hours and all that shit, late nights, duty, doesn't phase me. I'm over it - It's the military. And I get all that shit.

Clearly you see my mind is made up here already, I'm just looking for some non-biased kick back on my *idea here.*

I guess what I'm trying to really ask here is. How do you like the military right now? (And I know everyone's opinion is different or going to be different on this but from the current sources, whats going on now?). Are you regretting staying in right now - why, or did you regret retiring? What do you think about my idea here?

Basically I'm just thinking - and trying to realistically have an apporach or prepation about my plan/idea here of going back in. It's like if you have your boys and they tell you that chick is bad news, but you go through it anyway and later regret it, and wish you would have listened. Like I'm essentially just romanticizing about the idea of going back in, as an officer, to end up, maybe not enjoying being back in for whatever reason. Then regretting why I gave up all these other options that I could have, had.

Army,"Good morning, Team.

Context:

I'm on holiday leave from basic. I caught up with my employer and was given favorable news. I'm in the running for a promotion upon returning from OCS.

I chose to drill out of a unit 3 1/2 hours away in N.C. anticipating I would relocate to that particular area for a career opportunity. I was thinking long-term/big picture.

After being made aware of the prospects, I thought it best to be pragmatic, and drill with a unit closer to my residence in W.V./current employer (whether I get promoted or not). I'm happy with my civilian circumstances.

Question(s):

1. Is it possible to switch units during/immediately after IET?

2. If so, what would be the procedure?

My recruiter recommended I speak with the Reserve liaison at basic assuming the drill sergeants grant my request for an appointment. I figure it wouldn't hurt to ask the group for feedback.

If it doesn't work, I'm more than willing to make the drive without complaint. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but I'd like to explore any possibility of drilling in my home state.

I chose MP as my branch.

Any thoughts would be appreciated. I hope all is well.

Army,"Just to start off, I am not in a crisis or in need of help. 

For the past few months I have been extremely stressed about my family, personal relationships, my work section, immediate leaderships constantly babysitting with no cause, upcoming overseas PCS that is being stalled for medical reasons (no idea if serious because I have been referred to a specialist, so probably not great news coming in), going to school for a B.S. full time (so can pay for the classes and get out with a degree in time for my ETS), and just random small life annoyances like most recently a car repair among many other things that seem to bother me more and more as of late. In general the Army has given me what I feel like could be some sort of diagnosed anxiety disorder; I have not felt like my world is slowly closing around me making me physically sick since I was a child. I was more comfortable and healthy when I was 18 on the verge of homelessness and walking to my minimum wage job that pinned workers against each other to sell products with the reward of clocking more hours at the store because they would not hire people to work full time w/ reliable shifts (oddly enough I needed those hours). 

I want to seek help but what is even the point? Talking to someone won’t get me away from the situation I am in and the best part is I have a clearance so I could potentially lose my job and all future employment opportunities. Like I said in the beginning, this is not really a cry for help but maybe some people are in the same boat or have some thoughts about what I am saying.

For various reasons pertaining to my civilian life I decided to go ahead and enlist as an 88N today as I could not really afford to postpone my enlistment to wait for something else, and even then, I was informed that if I were to wait then the only things that would work with my timeframe, if they even became available, would be 68G or 68J.

Everyone and their mother gives the SMA grief because all we want is to grow a damn beard and I’m not going to lie, I’m one of those people because I HATE shaving every morning.

Instead of us walking around looking like fucked up Charlie Chaplins, let us extend our mustachios past the corners of our mouths. It is more natural and looks a hell of a lot better. There can still be standards implemented such as it not going below the corner of the mouth, and cannot extend past the top of the lip.

In my younger years (21-24) I was a complete fuck up. No direction in life. Got involved with political protesting. Nothing explicitly anti-government in nature, mostly environmental. Got arrested on three occasions. Only one misdemeanor (evading detention) ever stuck, but one of my arrests included two felony charges that were eventually dropped. My social media history is a bunch of extreme edge posting. And of course I experimented with drugs, ranging from cocaine to LSD. 

But eventually I got my shit together and have been a normal law abiding dude for the better part of a decade. I went off to college and earned a degree. I've been working a regular full time job for four years now. No criminal activities, no drugs. Got married and recently got divorced. Obviously I know not to lie about or try to conceal any of this.

Should I even bother trying to get a TS clearance with this much baggage? If I chose a job that requires a TS clearance and get denied, am I going to get reclassed as a cook or 11b or some shit?

We had a class that was taught by a civilian group about stress management. The class was about an hour long and they had a section on meditation/relaxing (going to your happy place). Everyone in the class fell asleep as you do in the Army. At the end of the class, they gave everyone brochures and a stress card. Like a mood ring, it changed colors. Everyone played with it and realized that it reacted to body temperature. Being in Colorado, everyone could make it turn black. Which supposedly indicated stress. Smart asses started telling their leaders, ""I can't do duty, SGT/LT. My stress card is black."" And it was definitely a joke. Just before I got out that year, I first heard that they were handing them out in BCT. All of the stress card related incidents that I heard of after, were a guy that knew a guy kind of thing.

Army,"Informational Post for you transitioning folks

For anyone unaware there exists a field in the civilian world called Biomedical Equipment Technician or BMET (there's also a MOS for it that offers some of the best training in the industry so reclassing for it to go reserves or guard is an option as well). You work in a hospital setting repairing and PMCSing medical equipment, everything from hospital bed to MRI machines. You do NOT need a degree to work in this field but having one does make you more marketable. That being said if you are looking to get into a technical field with little to no experience this is a good option.

Firstly there is the college portion. If you choose, you can use your skillbridge to pursue a 2 year degree or certificate as a BMET though the College of Biomedical Equipment Technology. It is completely remote and is done online. Furthermore they will work with hospitals in your area, (or area you plan to relocate to upon ETS) to find you OJT as well, but is not required to complete the course. The President of the college is an Army veteran himself and the school is very much set up to accommodate military service members. That being said, even if you don't purse it as a skillbridge the scheduling works where you could potentially (given you role/MOS) attend the college during your transition window without it being on skillbridge.[https://cbet.edu/programs/](https://cbet.edu/programs/)

Secondly, the company I will be working for, Trimedx, is an independent service provider and has contracts with hospitals all over the US. They also offer a skillbridge internship.

If you have any questions about the field, the college, Trimedx, or even other companies, please feel free to reach out and DM me any questions you might have.

Army,"I need help and advice about a serious situation my brother is in. I will try to provide the least information because I am afraid for his safety. He enlisted a few years ago and now lives overseas. He married another soldier not a year ago. None of his relatives know much about this person nor have met them in person.

He's being a victim of narcissistic abuse and it has become physical against him. His life has already been in danger. I convinced him to talk to his superiors which he did, but I have strong suspicion this may have backfired in the way that his abuser may have convinced him to get back together and take the fall for any reports he made. I believe even his career may be in danger. 

He's normally very communicative which drastically changed after the last violent event against him by his partner. I also have strong reasons to believe his phone is being monitored by his partner. I know for a fact that there has been times in which his social media posts and even text message replies have been done by his partner and not him. I am certain that since the last violent event against him occurred, his communication with his family is being monitored.

He's a sweet, kind person and unfortunately, this might make him the perfect person to be the victim of this. I not only fear for him facing consequences that do not belong to him, but also for his life and safety.   


What should I do? Should I call someone (his superiors or FAP)  to tell them what I know? Would that do any good? How can I make sure he's safe and that he has a support system that would understand narcissistic abuse and work with men who go through it? I will appreciate any advice and knowledge.

Army,"We met at the beginning of June, and have been talking every day since. He's in the US, and I'm in the UK. He's also a sergeant in the military, so he's busy but he responds to me the second he can. We haven't phone called or video called yet, admittedly because I'm too anxious to, but he's said that he'd find the time and we could whenever I'm ready. But we've sent each other photos, videos and voice messages, so I know he is who he says he is. We haven't made it official yet because he was going to ask me to be his girlfriend when he came to visit me for the first time next year.

But I don't know whether that's going to be possible now.

Back at the beginning of September, one morning he messaged me when he woke up that he wasn't feeling well and was going to see the doctor (he's 6 hours behind me, it was around 12 noon my time). I was getting super worried as he didn't respond until 10pm that same day, and told me that he'd been taken to the hospital. He said that he wouldn't be able to talk for long as his phone was going to be taken off him. I never knew why he was in there (I was too scared to know and I also thought I didn't have a right to know as we weren't officially dating), but he got his phone back more and more and after a few days, he was out and back at work again.

Everything was fine for a while.

But then he didn't respond again for almost 48 hours. On the 12th of November, I found out that he was in hospital again. This time he told me that he'd had a heart attack and that he was going to be okay. He's had his phone very little, usually only a few times a day, sometimes even just the once. As far as I'm aware, he was still in there up until the night of the 4th of December, and I haven't heard from him since (just over 2 weeks now). He's just completely disappeared on me, and I'm absolutely terrified.

I don't have the contact details of any of his family or friends, I'd never thought to ask as I assumed this would happen later on down the line. The only forms of social media he has are Snapchat and Discord (he isn't big on social media), so there's no way I can ""stalk"" him to somehow find their details either. I've tried searching his name and everything I possibly can to find any news online, but there's nothing.

He's a very very honest person, and I know he wouldn't lie about any of this. I really don't want to assume the worst as that will break my heart, at the moment nothing is certain. I have no way of finding anything out. I also have severe anxiety so the waiting game is basically torture.

I turned green right before hbl and now weigh 185. My cardio has improved tremendously started with a 23ish min 2 mile pushing myself and did an acft before leave and got a 14:32 2 mile (dont mean to toot my horn but honestly couldve gone faster even) and went from D group to the front of B group in the company runs but fuck I used to be able to do 50 push ups and was totally spent after just 24 pushups and went from pushing myself and doing a 300 deadlift to barely doing only 220.. My drills definitely ripped me a new one for it. I feel weaker and weaker everyday. In the next phases will this change?  Do they start giving us more time to eat or possibly more protein? It's honestly frustrating as hell. I eat every bit of protein I can in the dfac but I can't just shovel food in my face like others can and if I eat too fast I just throw up after when we inevitably hear half right face or get thrown in the pit.

In 2021 I was having a rough time at home and Genesis flagged me for depression and SI. I got a positive psych consult but waiver was denied. I’m very physically fit (27 pull-ups pr, 152lbs) and determined and I’m in a very good headspace. After the first time my waiver was denied my MC recruiters let me know I would have to wait a while to resubmit my waiver for another shot and advised me to at least consider Army as an option. So I visited the Army recruiter and they were confident in my waiver being approved. Fast forward until a couple weeks ago my MC recruiter calls me and a Colonel wants to meet me at PT to try to get an exemption to policy. Basically, MEPS is going to give me a date to go back for a second consult and possibly be approved but if they deny me I’ll be sent to the San Diego depot to do the IST and they’ll make a final decision. However MEPS is taking their merry sweet time and my appointment could be months away, and then who knows how long if I have to go to the depot for the IST. I don’t want to let my recruiters down and I’ve always wanted to join MC, but I’m having a hard time stalling my life. I’m almost 20 and I’ve been trying to get in since I graduated in 22’.

I was active duty, ETS'd to the IRR for a short period, and joined a USAR unit in late 2021. My contract time on the DA3540 was for ""3 years."" The IRR recruiter explained that because of a form update at the time, she could only stick me with the unit for a 3 year period, and I'd be placed back in the IRR upon my release. But the orders printed out for the new unit were until the end of my IRR contract, and for a two year period I'd either get shuffled from S1 or RPAC when trying to fix the issue.

Fast-forward to now and I've filed a PAR and discussed the issue with my units retention NCO, but our RPAC office hasn't kept me updated on the process, and I had to push just for them to say they only partially had my paperwork and needed ""enlistment forms, like your original DD-4."" Of course, I gave it to them. My worry is that this isn't going to be solved when my contract ends, and they're going to try and keep me in the unit.

Army,"You’re probably thinking “wtf are you talking about weirdo?” Well I’ll tell you. I’ve had this discussion with multiple NCOs lately and we all kind of agreed that the new definition of professionalism that’s come to be is breeding a bad culture. Now granted the Army has fixed a lot of things that needed fixing in the name of professionalism but certain things, like not singling out Soldiers, avoiding confrontation, etc. has essentially created a culture of talking shut behind someone’s back and not being able to call people out on their bullshit. 

Now I’m sure my combat arms folks probably don’t have this problem as much but my fellow POGs and especially my non-FORSCOM POGs may be able to attest to this. You can’t confront someone because it’s bullying and unprofessional, you have to address the group during a fuck up when it’s very clear one person fucked up and should be called out on that but you can’t otherwise it’s targeting and bullying

Now I’ll definitely say some leaders definitely went overboard and straight up targeted and harassed people who didn’t deserve it and said leader just wanted to flex their green weenie, but I think the Army definitely overcorrected.

Army,"Currently AD 15Y getting medboarded for bilateral wrist issues ( Left wrist ECU subluxation and Right wrist TFCC tear) during the medboard process I was in a car accident and while bracing before impact, the energy transfered through my right hand to my wrist, shoulder blade and neck. My usability of my right wrist and hand has now worsened. PEBLO has ""OKed"" me for surgery on the left as it is my dominant hand and on the waitlist pending updated mri of my right wrist to see if further damage is present. 

My question is should hold off the surgery until I get out through the VA? I will eventually need surgery on both wrists. My mum used to work for the VA hospital and knows the horror stories of veterans waiting for care. I've heard improvements have been done through the news but I am sure going through this community would give me better insight.

Also, my plan is to get out medically from army and go back to school via Gi bill and get my 2nd bachelors in advertising. I was originally going to work on helicopters components in line with my MOS, but considering my wrist issues I feel it would be safer to return to my creative nature.

Potential options I am weighing:

° Get out no surgery, get care through VA eventually.
° Get surgery on left, get out, get care through VA eventually for right wrist.
° Get surgery on both wrists, get out with lower VA percentage or possibly found fit for duty.

Army,"How long did your conditional release take?

So a little back story. I finished my active duty contract in February of 2022 and rolled into the reserves. So I’ve been in the reserves since February of 2022. I signed a 4 year contract so it ends in 2026. A few months in, I realized i made a mistake. The reserves is ass. But I kept trucking on. I’ve been struggling alot financially, and mentally. I was gonna wait until the end of the contract to go back active but i dont want to wait that long so I am about to start the process of a conditional release. I know it can take awhile but if anyone has experienced it, how long did yours take? Any advice you can give me? Also if you got a bonus, did you pay it back? And if you’re married to an AD soldier, can you be at the same duty station or does the big army send you wherever once active again?

I noticed they all had old, busted M-16s and I noticed one of them had his magazine inserted in UPSIDE DOWN AND with no rounds in it, although that might have been a good thing. I politely informed him, and he had no clue what I was talking about. He didn’t understand that his magazine was upside down and he didn’t understand he didn’t have any rounds.

Army,"I’ve never posted on Reddit before, so I hope it’s ok I ask for some lenience. I’ve been with my boyfriend for two years, and I’ve never been more in love with a person. I am 19, he is 20, and I know I’m young and naive, but I can’t imagine a future without him. I’ve known since meeting him he’s wanted to join the army. It’s always been a hard subject to talk about, as I never supported it. I have strong negative opinions about the army (I’m trying to learn more, as I want to be more comfortable when he speaks about it) and he also knows this. For a long time we’d procrastinate and avoid talking about the army because I didn’t wanna hear it. 

About a year ago he dropped out of college because he just figured he couldn’t do it. He had a good job, and it wasn’t like he had no where to go. He has a loving family, a friend group, a good job, a girlfriend. But I know he’s always wanted to do this. I know it’s something bigger than me, and it wasn’t fair of me to try to convince him otherwise, to just be an EMT or a cop, anything but leaving me for the army. I couldn’t stand the thought. But he went to the recruiters and after a lot of back and forth papers on medical issues he finally was accepted. He only had ten days before leaving. And two days before he left, he told me he signed for six years instead of four, though he had previously told me four. It broke my heart. In BCT he sent me letters, telling me how much he loved me. I never responded, it was too painful. I’d write drafts but never send them. 

When he got to AIT he called, and we talked for hours, FaceTiming everyday in his personal time. It felt good. Having him home for the holidays feels intoxicating, I’ve missed him so much and every second I’m around him I feel high off of him. But I know he is leaving again soon. I don’t know how people do this, I don’t know where to start on opening up to knowing things about the army. I hate guns, I have strong opinions on them, but he has a strong interest in them and it makes me uncomfortable. 

Is it worth it to try to change my mindset for him and this relationship? I want it to be but I don’t want to lose my own morals. Does anyone have advice on how to navigate this? How did you manage to stay together through the absence? Was it all worth it and after their time served is it easier? 

TLDR: I need advice on how to stay with a boy going into the army

edit: I am open to hearing what I don’t want to hear, but I am also looking for advice on how to open myself up to better improve my knowledge on the army to help support him.

Army,"Greetings Reddit,

I am set to deploy for basic training on January 2nd, having chosen the 94R (Survivability and Equipment Repairer) MOS and entering as an E4. The reason I'm reaching out to Reddit is that I've been grappling with serious doubts about my decision to join the Army. To provide some context, I went through a mid-life crisis, left my hometown, and moved up north with my mother to pursue this path. In doing so, I left everything behind with no intention of returning. My impulsive nature led me to make this significant decision in a relatively short timeframe, deciding to enlist in September. Now, with about a week left before I ship out, I'm second-guessing my choice. It feels like I rushed into this commitment without fully considering the implications of the 4-5-year contract I'm about to sign.

My tendency to overthink things has me questioning whether I should have pursued Officer Candidate School (OCS) instead of enlisting to secure a more stable future. Despite these second thoughts, I feel pressured to join the Army due to the financial constraints and debt I'm currently facing. I regret not taking more time to research my military options before making such a life-changing decision. Unfortunately, that ship has sailed, and I must face the reality of my current situation.

I find myself at a crossroads, torn between my unsatisfying old life, despite having education, skills, and a strong work ethic, and the potential for a steady income and success with the Army. Fearful of making the wrong decision that will impact years of my life, I feel a sense of urgency to choose a path quickly.

For clarity, I have a 4-year-old son whose mother supports my decision to join the Army. We had a 50/50 agreement for our son's custody before I left, aiming to ensure his access to both parents despite our separation. The stark reality of the Army's distance from my son has recently hit me, leading to feelings of depression.

Despite feeling lost, I believe pursuing the Army is my only choice at this point to avoid drowning in debt. It's a disconcerting sensation, as it seems like I'm joining the military for reasons different from my initial expectations.

I'm open to answering any questions about my situation and would appreciate any feedback, whether positive or negative.",Seeking Guidance and Feedback on Military Decision and Concerns,[],r/army,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,Laghodesssa,-0.4540574096615417,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,21,6
Army,"We're in a weird spot with uniforms. We got the new greens rolling out, and we're also hanging onto the blues for wear whenever someone wants to shame newer troops for not having the blues. And greens become the ""service uniform"" in 2028. 

We also have this black wool sock with a blue patch on it that goes on your head (the beret). That sock goes with the blues (and sometimes OCPs), that we may or may not EVER wear again after 2028. It's not useful, no one wears it on even a semi-regular basis, and new troops don't know how to shave/shape it. When it's part of the uniform for a ceremony, a lot of troops look like pizza chefs. 

So. Why keep it? Seriously. The black beret is like an ex we broke up with over ten years ago that we still have a pictures of in the house. It's sad, depressing, and our friends look at us weird when we bring it up.

Seriously, someone on the uniform board needs to get up and say ""We're throwing this thing in the trash in 2028"" or ""It's back for daily wear. Always and all the time"".

Army,"I've been thinking about how the Army treats driving a lot recently. My specific base has \~60% of the soldiers in the unit living in barracks 30-45 minutes away from their place of duty. That leads to a lot of ride sharing, which has consistently led to soldiers having give rides in difficult circumstances. I'm all for ride sharing but it shouldn't be a requirement. I actually had to drive my NCO to work for a solid 6 months and never received any compensation, but moving on. 

There's a non-zero amount of soldiers here who can't legally drive because they don't have a US state driver's license required to apply for the host nation equivalent. Most people gloss over the word ""state"" when dealing with that, but that seems like a huge issue to me. It baffles me that soldiers are required to interface with the DMV/BMV from their home state just to certify that they are a competent driver.

A significant amount of people join the military for the express purpose of distancing themselves from their home, and that has an overlap with soldiers who, for whatever reason, don't have a license when they join or have a license that expires after they join. There are a lot of extrapolations to be made from this circumstance, but the biggest one in my mind is that soldiers who either can't or don't want to go back to their home state might not be able to maintain their driving privileges. 

Many DMV/BMV's have restrictions on how much they allow you to do remotely. Not to mention, they are generally extremely strict and may require multiple appointments to resolve an issue. This is a fundamental conflict with the military because a huge amount of soldiers don't reside is the same state as their DMV/BMV. In my unit's circumstance, they are stationed a $800-$1500 plane ticket away. Factoring in more considerations like leave, lodging, and transportation, It's a monumental task to undertake with no support from the military.

It seems to me that there is an extremely simple, albeit congress-level, solution to this. The creation of a DOD-wide ""Military driver's license"" would be an increase in quality of life for many soldiers. It could be a bona-fide ID card and simply certify that the holder is a trained and competent operator of motor vehicles. Testing could be performed in the same way they do motorcycle safety classes with a small classroom portion and then a practical test.

I know this issue isn't high visibility like mold or low pay, but I feel it's an important one nonetheless. In the meantime, I'll keep praying my engine doesn't seize up and my tires stay leakless.

Army,"Hey everyone, recently I’ve been looking and wanting to join the Army as 35T but I’m stuck atm, here’s why.

Mid 2018 I was in highschool (minor) when a group of kids got in trouble, including myself. Long story short, I smoked marijuana for the first and only time. Few days later we all get caught. I had a cartridge battery in my bag (no residue of any sort as far as I can remember) when a police officer discovered it. They sent it to go get “it tested” I didn’t hear anything back from them. I received a misdemeanor for Drug paraphernalia that day. They called my parents to the school, explained the situation and we went home. I was never placed under arrest, never went/faced a judge/ nor did I get my finger prints taken. I did a diversion program that expunges your charge when you’re 18. I completed what was needed and got a letter in the mail when I turned 18 stating my charge has been “expunged” from my record (I know it can still be brought up) After highschool I started working for the Gov and was told I need a clearance. Filled out the SF86 form and listed my accident that happened. They asked questions and was given my clearance that same day. I want to see what the possibility is for me getting a TS/SCI that is required for 35T mos ? Do I have a shot at this ?? 

I plan on being 100% truthful about it

And high in the sky
A single, lone plane
Through the air did fly

On board a Paratrooper
And pallets of toys
Ready for heavy drop
To good girls and boys

Now Santa stands ready
Only ten minutes more
The jumpmaster says
""Stand in the door!""

Santa Claus jumps out
As the red light turns green
His parachute rigged toys
From the ground can be seen

The toys fall in chimneys
All across the land
Bringing joy and smiles
And a Christmas so grand

The Christmas drop was successful
And Santa PLFs with precision
Because Santa is a Paratrooper
With the 82nd Airborne Division

Happy Holidays!

&gt;After  years of headlines and watchdog reports condemning shoddy living  conditions for service members and families, a consensus appears to be  developing between Army senior leaders, housing executives and even  lawmakers that something drastic must occur to fix the service’s  barracks and family housing for good.  
&gt;  
&gt;Army  Secretary Christine Wormuth has repeatedly called for a “generational  investment” in the service’s housing and barracks stock that goes beyond  the constraints of the regular budgeting process, in which every  investment comes at the cost of another priority.

Ah yes, throw more studies at the problem. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; But some critics are concerned that the service might struggle to take  care of its new and repaired buildings even if such an investment were  to occur. The Army systematically underfunded barracks maintenance  during much of the War on Terror era in order to fund other priorities. 

The problem is that the Army (DOD as a whole really) loves to play the ""we can't fix the barracks or family housing because we spent those funds and we can't raid another pot of money"" and then the service either delays or DOES raid the money for the barracks because ""readiness"". 

If the Army is serious about fixing the issue, the money needs to be locked down.  I don't care if some BDE needs to deploy but couldn't manager their funds or if there are weeds on the small arms ranges.  The money to fix the barracks and family housing should ONLY be spent on housing. 

Fixing housing won't solve all the QOL issues but it will fix one of the biggest ones.

Army,"Hello! Tell me if I am utterly screwed or if I am showing symptoms, please.

Nitty Gritty:

I just passed ten years of service in the reserve. I have one deployment in the past and a med board that followed four years later that cleared me to stay in.

I did three years of therapy, talked all the feelings out, and felt a lot better mentally. I submitted a VA claim somewhere in there and received 60% for a generalized stress and anxiety disorder, tinnitus, and shoulder surgery with a LOD. 

Fun Facts: 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a couple of years after my first deployment, hence the med-board. However, they cleared me after my psychologist reassessed me and diagnosed me with borderline personality disorder. 

The following year I was diagnosed with ADHD. Again, news to me, I have been in for eight years at this point and am shitting myself on what was going to happen to me. 

I got kicked off a deployment about two weeks ago and was going to leave soon. I was told I might be medically separated or retired since I am at 60% disability and have much time in service.

Question:

Can I be dishonorably or other than honorably discharged for this?

Should I expect to lose my VA disability or retirement benefits?

I am anxious about it since these both occurred in service well into my career, and I planned on doing my 20 years before leaving. Now, I'm about to lose it all when I was planning on deploying and taking pride in my service and growth. 

The other shitty thing is my lizard brain is saying, ""Well, that stuff was definitely made worse with service, so go refile with VA.""

I’m here to get advice and do some research. I intend to post this post in the weight loss/fitness community too, but figured I could try to ask here as well.

I am 22 years old. I am graduating this month with a certified diploma, but want to use this new year to get my ass in gear and start a cut to get fit and ready for enlistment. I’ve spoken to the Army and Marine Corps recruiters, and they are encouraging me to do a few workouts with them and even come get weighed in/taped at the end of every month till I meet their standards. Currently I am researching the pros and cons of each branch before making a in stone decision.

Now, until I reach a certain weight, running/rucking isn’t in motion just yet, but calisthenics and weight lifting is. I wanted to see if anyone could give me advice on which workout routine worked for them? I am looking at a Hybrid Split, but I’ve also heard about PPL x Arnold and 5x5.

The hardest part about my commitment is the nutritional side, I want to hit a high protein calorie deficit, but I work a 5am - 3pm labor job M-F. So F-M are my gym days, so does anyone have any advice on meal prep or anything to help hit my goals?

I’m just in need of any advice or tips, so feel free to throw in your workout routines, your diet plans, supplements, hell, even extra stuff I should know before enlistment. Please and thank you.

Reason I'm asking is that my dad, who passed away in 2020, was in the 11th ACR at two very significant times in their history:  During the Cold War in Germany from 1959 - 1963 and in Vietnam from 1966 - 67.  In fact, Dad was recalled to active duty in the Summer of 1966 when I was 4 years old and we briefly moved to Fort Meade, MD, where the regiment trained up for their deployment.  Then in late Summer they sailed from San Francisco to Vietnam.  Dad was an officer (1LT when he was reactivated and he made Captain while he was in Vietnam.)  I think his last job was Regimental Assistant S3 Air.  

Anyway, when my dad passed away I got a box of ""stuff"" much of which relates to his time with the 11th Cav.  I'm almost 62 and have no kids, and I'd rather give it to a historian than just toss it in the trash.

Prior service Marine coming in as a 35P E5. Shipping to DLI soon and had a few questions.

1. Am I supposed to get my new CAC prior to shipping to DLI?   
My recruiter assumed I just arrive to DLI without one and that sounds off.
2. Will I receive a set of OCP/ASU or am I SOL and required to spend out of pocket?   
I read through older posts saying that uniforms will be issued at AIT, is this the case at DLI?
3. Do I get issued any gear at DLI or is everything issued at AIT?

Army,"Hello everyone,

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I was previously in the army reserve for 6 years. As soon as I switched into active duty, I noticed I was being paid at 0 years TIS instead of 6 years. I immediately went to finance to try to get it fixed and they pointed me to retention. 

I submitted an MMPA packet to retention that corrected my BASD giving me an extra 8-9 months of active duty time, but my PEBD remained the same. Since then, I've been following up with retention every 1-2 months for updates on getting it fixed. Fast forward to now, apparently an MMPA wasn't even what was needed to getting my PEBD (TIS pay) fixed; rather it needed to be my retirement points and a 1506. My brigade retention submitted the 1506 after my battalion retention NCO PCS'd recently, but DFAS pushed it back for an error after 60 days. 

After 30 days of waiting for my brigade retention NCO to resubmit it with the fix, he ended up resubmitting the same 1506 with no changes to DFAS thinking for some reason that it was never submitted in the first place and that the base finance civilian pushed it back to us even though she literally emailed us both with the case number and I called DFAS to check the status on it.

Do you guys think I've given it enough time for retention to fix this issue? I'm going on terminal leave in 4 months and based on my calculations, I'm owed like $18,000 pretax in back pay. I have zero hope for the army to fix my pay once I'm out as a civilian. I'm thinking of submitting a congressional, but I don't know if I should wait for DFAS to push back the current 1506 and then do it or submit the congressional right now to get it on people's radar.",2.5 years of incorrect pay - is it time to go nuclear?,[],r/army,0.5147701864069739,3.743597967002159,3.743597967002159,0,1,0,0,0,throwaway125675463,4.366783929036067,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,13,2

November, got DA selected for recruiting as part of that scare while is ALC Phase 1.
Got magic and shoved to the right in March.
Got required MOS training in December with days out of training only myself for my critical section(no time to house hunt.

Got ALC Phase 2 in Jan and get out Feb.
Don't know if after completing recruiting I will be PCSed or not despite not having the time in service and I won't have it(not reenlisting)

Not gonna go through everything to get a place in February to just risk breaking contract  and waste time if I have to move.

Immediate leadership tracking and even CSM cool with it. Been worried about brigade finding out and pushing the issue and with every manner of rank asking me questions.

DS Johnson replies “no.”

“Ok so there are three midgets all sitting around talking. One realizes, “hey! I have really small hands” and decides that he will get it verified by the Guinness book of world records to see if he has the smallest hands in the world. 

The next midget looks down and says “gee, I think I might have the smallest feet in the world. I’ll go too!”

Finally the third midget looks down and goes “damn. I think I’ve got the smallest dick in the world, I’d better tag along and see if I can get the world record too!” 

So the next day they all walk in to the Guinness book of world records office. 

The first midget walks out after about an hour and a half with a huge grin on his face. “I got it! I have the smallest hands in the world!” He exclaims. 

The second midget comes out about thirty minutes later, smiling ear to ear. He says the same thing “I have the smallest feet in the world!” 

Finally, the third midget comes out of the office shortly after the second. He looks shaken up and really disappointed. His buddies ask “what happened!”

I’m not sure why she’s just now deciding to bring this up, I legitimately never expected her to move with me, asked her to put her career on hold and have only brought up getting her drivers license as a necessity for her to continue with the company she’s spent six years with at their highest selling branch. 

I’ve tried to run logistics about making it work, telling her I can rent a shitty one bedroom and fly her and my youngest child up every now and then but she ultimately made the decision to move with me to my first duty station so I’m confused as to why I am getting the guilt trip all of the sudden while I’m on Holiday Block Leave.

Army," 

Hello,

I decided to share my experience and knowledge of REFRAD'n. Know that everyone's experience will be different, in my case I was an O3E getting out at 8 years. Here's what I learned:

THE PROCESS:

1. Receive your last OER and it's been submitted to HQDA/in your iPerms. Only matters if you plan on a DOD job where they'll ask for your OERs


2. 18 months out, you NEED to start SFL-TAP (only requires commander signature, not 2 levels up)


3. Once finished with SFL-TAP, take the CSP portion of the SFL-TAP courses. The CSP class is mandatory to part-take in a CSP which I recommend everyone try to do. 


4. Find a CSP you want to do, (3 letter agencies do have CSPs) it can also be any business/organization as long as it's not your immediate family's and you cannot be paid by the internship. If the CSP is not a known one to the DOD it will take longer, but that doesn't mean you can't do it. It can be anywhere up to 6 months and can only be done during your last 180 days of active duty.


5. Talk to the company. Get the company/organization to soft-select you and start CSP paperwork from the transitions office. You'll need to fill out the nformation, such as what you'll be doing and the layout of the internship. (This step takes 2 weeks for transitions to be approved and 2 weeks for legal review, SO START EARLY)


6. If you can't find a good CSP and still want to take advantage of it, apply for Cameron-Brooks, Alliance Careers, or any JMO recruiting organization. They have the fastest most streamlined processes for CSPs, it's all online and mostly helps you generally transition into the civilian workforce. Know that most of these are trying to place you in a corporate business since they receive money/benefits for finding and placing you. 


7. Simultaneously, as you're looking for a CSP and started the CSP paperwork, collect and submit your REFRAD packet. It will need Commander, BC, BDE signature and endorsement. Stay up to date on your CoC because they will ""lose"" and ""hold"" your paperwork to make you reconsider. (This step took me 8 months due to upper-level commanders waiting for CoCs to push it to the next guy, which made me restart from scratch as the signatures all had to be redone with new names).


8. REFRAD signed by BDE CMDR is only the first step, it needs to go to HQDA and your branch (make sure BDE S1 submits it to HQDA/Branch/Retirement Office) sometimes they'll just give you the packet and you'll assume they submitted it to your retirement office. Everyone has to ""vote"" to let you out and strength/manning, branch manager, board, etc. This process all the way to HQDA takes \~2 Months, so stay on top of where your packet is sitting. (Note: IPSS-A was not out while I did my REFRAD so it could be quicker now). (In my case specifically due to the ""brown-out"" my packet sat at branch/HQDA for about 5 months, which because I was now considered excess strength due to declining CCC, I was deployed downrange and didn't find out my REFRAD was accepted till 1/2 through the deployment).


9. While this is going on, GO TO THE DOCTOR. Whatever you plan on claiming with the VA must be on your military record. If you don't plan on claiming anything or feel/get told you're taking advantage, all I can say is the VA medical process is 100% your choice. No one can force you either way. The way I see it, it's your personal choice to decide whether you feel you were injured enough to seek medical treatment and it is to be documented that it occurred while serving. The VA needs 3 things for a successful claim. A. See doctor and issue recorded. B. Full Diagnosis. C. Treatment (must be ongoing/more than once). I recommend you read 38 CFR for whatever conditions you plan on claiming and it'll tell you the exact criteria needed for what percentages. Even if your issue doesn't rate any percentage, a 0% service-connected is still a VA disability (This can always be appealed as well), but make sure if you want to submit a claim to capture everything you want documented as service-connected. You only have 1 year after separating for the issue to be assumed service-connected, afterwards, it's extremely difficult to justify the issue and will need either Buddy Letters, DBQ, Sworn Statements, etc. 


10. Once your REFRAD gets back from HQDA and is fully approved, start your leave form, your CSP needs to be fully approved by this point too. 

11. Set your CSP for your last 6 months in the army. If you have leave, take it prior to the start of your CSP (don't sell it, you're losing money (BAH/BAS/COLA) if you do and if you go GS it counts against leave you want to sell as a government civilian in the future as there is a cap).

Example of the best case: 60 days of leave and 6-month CSP, need clearing papers 10 days prior to leave start date, clear the army, take leave, start CSP. Complete.

Example if not full 6 month CSP: 10 days clear army, 4-month CSP, 2 months of leave (can start a job during leave to get double pay). But know that if you have a 4-month CSP and say 65 days of leave, you won't be able to take those 5 days and will have to sell it. 


12. \*\*SUBMIT!!!\*\* Fully submit your VA claim at minimum 3 months from your separation date. If you miss it by even a day, you're going to wait a year+ to get your ratings and another 6+ months to get a paycheck. (You will be back paid assuming you receive a rating above 0%).


13. You need to plan this all out in order to know what day you're setting as your last day in the Army. Once you set it, it's a pain in the ass to change it and usually takes 2 months to change. So KNOW YOUR DATE after calculating CSP, Leave (include leave accrued during CSP and while on Leave), and clearing times.


14. Congrats, you completed the REFRAD process. 


15. Most important thing to note, no one gives a shit you're getting out. Almost none of your active duty (coworkers/bosses) personnel know the process of getting out because they haven't done it yet. They don't know what they're talking about and they most definitely don't give a shit about you getting out. Take control of your own process and don't let anyone bully you. Set your medical appointments and go, stop giving a shit if your boss is mad you're gone a lot, or if you receive profiles. The transitioning process is stressful and takes a lot of time/commitment (which is why a lot of my peers just end up staying). So do your due diligence and start planning now.

Notes: 

Once you have a separation date, here are 3 companies to join. Hiring our Heros (they will literally write your resume for you, give you mock interviews, or help you start a business) all for free. American Legion, a $45 entry fee, but if you need help with the VA process, they will assign you a VSO to help you submit your claim. Wounded Warrior Project, can also help submit your VA claim by assigning you a VSO, though it's harder and takes a lot longer for WWP to reply.

The 90 days after active duty Tricare is fake, don't believe it. Tricare removes you as a sponsor immediately, I've tried calling and getting added back in but to no avail. Have a plan for medical care and insurance, especially if you need follow-up appointments for your VA claim. Also if you need medication. (I have been without some of my necessary medications for a while now due to the long process of finding a PCP where I'm at).

AMEX Gold/Platinum, Chase Sapphire Reserve, and other credit cards. They know immediately once you're separated. They have a 3-month grace period for no annual fees so either have a plan to cancel or pay the fees. There's some good article about downgrading your cards as well. (NOTE: If you cancel your cards and you still have redemption points to spend, they will VANISH. Spend all your points prior to cancelation). SCRA for interest rates only applies WHILE ON active duty. If you have a card or student loan that is receiving an SCRA rate locked at 4%, it will go up to whatever the national average is (\~15%) so pay off your cards prior to getting out/student loans.

For the 10 years of federal service for student loan forgiveness, if you switch to a government civilian job (GS) that time will count. If you're a contractor, that time will not count. Have a plan for your TSP as you will need to roll it into something else if you don't plan on going GS. (Can be into a personal retirement fund account, or wherever you get hired at's 401K plan).

If you do want to go GS, buy back your time. Say you did 6 years, you can ""buy back"" that time into your GS pension, which is 100% worth it, but you will need to have money set aside to pay for it. Calculate it prior to transitioning. 

You can sign up for VGLI (similar to SGLI) up to 120 days after separating. I'd say it's a decent price for what you get, but the best part is they will not evaluate you for any medical conditions. So could be worth it depending on your situation. 

Once you separate, if they let you keep your CAC (the way to do this is to make sure you tell DEERs you're still in the IRR for however long you owe still), know that it deactivates in about a week after separation. If you have emails you want to save, do it now. If you get scanned at the gate with said CAC, they will take it. If you try to use the commissary, the card will not work. (If you did the VA steps correctly and received any disability, including 0% but service-connected, you will get a Veterans ID that allows you to use the MWR and Commissary). 

Create your DS Login and DON'T FORGET the password. Once your CAC deactivates the only way to sign into MyPay, MHS Genesis, iPerms, etc is with your DS Login.

LinkedIn has a free premium membership for active duty personnel for 1 year. I recommend using it as well as ZipRecruiter, and Cleared Jobs. That's how I found my current job. Check Silent Profesionals if you had a cool job while in. 

Also, if you are going to receive an ETS award, ask your CoC to do it early. I didn't receive mine till after my separation date and now I have a long process ahead of me to get it added to my DD214 (turning it into a DD215). For all you dirty priors, if you have old DD214s or ERBs, bring them with you when you have your DD214 day. It's the only form the clerks usually allow to input enlisted service data.

Lastly, Good Luck and Congratulations on your Transition! If you are on the fence about getting out, don't let the process deter you. My mentor put it this way, decide and weigh the good days vs the bad days. Once the bad days start to out-weigh the good, it's time to find something that makes you happy. ",REFRAD and Transitioning Trips and Tricks,[],r/army,0.6739347389220144,-0.21034204962500036,-0.21034204962500036,0,1,1,0,0,origamirice19,-0.48776958685523125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,3

I am a reservist deploying June 1 per mobilization orders. I have had Tricare Reserve Select(TRS) for a long time and have paid my premiums through June 1. My unit S1 runs me for early Tricare Prime on March 1 which is when I am put on a manning document. I was not aware about this as on previous long-term ADOS orders, I only got Tricare Prime when the orders started. However due to Tricare cycle, Tricare does not reflect Prime until April 1. Milconnect has a letter on April 1 saying I was no longer eligible for TRS as of March 1. Unfortunately, I don't realize it until May 1 when I checked my Tricare Humana beneficiary portal as I routinely do. I don't check milconnect that often.

Problem is I started out of network physical therapy on March 15 to take care of minor pains and aches. Out of network care is much better than in-network. So when the PT office and Tricare sync up, I am still on TRS. After talking to both my PT office AND Tricare Humana, I am now liable for out of pocket costs for the 15-20 PT visits I had from March 15 to May 1 to both PT and Humana which is like $2k. While I have been paying my copay, the PT claims never processed.

S1 was informed recently and is trying to figure this out. Essentially, my S1 changed me from a PPO to an HMO aka changed my health insurance w/o telling me. I'm asking to put me back on TRS until the deployment starts but I'm told it's not that simple.

Army,I don’t know if anyone can help me with this or not but it’s worth a shot! I’m a “PFC” by rank when I got chosen at basic training to be ranked up from pvt2 to PFC. Now this is when the question / story gets funny!! I got ranked up when ippsa was just getting launched so when I got to ait I was still getting paid Pvt2 pay and when I reached out to my leadership about the issue they looked at it and said I had a par just sitting there and that they could not do a thing but resubmit one which they did. Also I had proof that I got ranked up at basic BUT what they did not tell me that is a 1sgt cannot sign the paper for me and my peers to be ranked up. So I just really need some insight on this I’m at ft cavazos now and my leadership swears they are doing what they can to get this resolved but I have not seen a change in my pay.

Army,So recently I was diagnosed by a civilian doctor with ADHD I have been taking medication for 30 days and as of 2 days ago I switched medication due to heart palpitations. I know there is a 90 day no deployment rule while stabilizing on Stimulant Medication. My doctor will not prescribe me with more than a 30 day dose until that 90 day reevaluation. My doctor has written formal letters on my behalf saying I am not stable and I need continuous monitoring. I’ve pushed it up through my chain of command and am getting no info back. All I receive is “thank you for that.” Or “we need this” but no understanding of what to expect. My doctor evaluated me and wrote an additional letter stating my symptoms could be dangerous being that I am an 11B. Heard nothing back. I don’t know what I am supposed to do. I’ve talked to the GI Hotline and received information regarding what next steps I could take and I’ve done some of them but it’s killing me as this deployment creeps closer that I have 0 guidance.,"National Guard, PreMob coming up.

Army,"Cheif recently informed my platoon that the Army is ceasing all funding and operations for our MOS of 15W (UAS operator for the RQ7 Shadow) in 3 months firm. He talked us through some of the possibilities of what may become of us, but as for now nothing is certain. Big Army was originally planning on replacing the Shadow platform in 2027 with something else, but this news came out of nowhere and way ahead of schedule. None of the experimental platforms they're considering are ready yet, so our MOS will most likely cease to exist.

Some of the possibilities he talked about included MOS swapping us to another 15 series MOS or something else entirely, getting put into ""admin positions"" within the Battalion or Brigade (basically being a detail bitch for the rest of our contracts), or equipping us with commercially available quadcopters and having us roll with infantry platoons (sounds unlikely). But it's all guess work.

What he didn't mention was the possibility of an early ETS, probably so we don't get our hopes up. What are the chances of that, based on the precedents when these kind of things happen (surely this isn't the first time a MOS specific platform is prematurely cut). If they try to reclass me, am I able to deny it and get out early? If so, what kind of discharge would I be looking at?

It's a 6 year contract and I have 3 years left. Plenty of time to retrain and fill another position, but I signed up this and only this. Why should I spend the next 3 years doing a job I didn't sign up for because Big Army changed the terms of the deal at no fault of my own?

Army,"I am a German Citizen and live in Germany so I apologize for any mistakes. I think my problem might be partially a civil matter but I just dont know what to do anymore and was hoping maybe somebody has a helpful tip.

So my story is that my exhusband (E6) has not paid Child Support for over six years. Well, he has dfas set up that the monthly amount is being send to a joint bank account of us that I didnt have access to for all those years and he has been taking it from this account the whole time. Back in the day I did try to get in contact with the Army and talked to his Chain of command but for some reason I stopped getting responses so I gave up. This time I was not backing down and got in contact with the IG Office in April last year. They got me in contact with his Captain and after a couple of emails the Captain didnt respond to me anymore. I tried my best to explain that yes the money is being send to the agreed account (an allotment was set up because there were problems of him not paying before) but 1. I dont have access to it anymore because he changed all the passwords and I am not able to get a new card because it would have been shipped to his address and he sure as hell would not send it to me and 2. He has been taking the money a couple of days after arriving. So after some waiting time I got in contact with the IG Office again and then got the email address of his Lieutenant Colonel. So I explained everything and same thing happened. He even said to the Lt Col that I was solely on this bank account and i send her proof that that wasnt true but she still stopped responding to me. 

I unterstand I am just some annoying ex wife and i always wanted to make sure I expressed how grateful I was to get a response and that I am sorry for taking important time of someones day but I just want this issue to be resolved. I dont want to sue for Child Support and all the years he missed and ruin his life. I only care about now and that it works. I also wouldnt contact all those people if he would just talk to me and figure things out.
So after all that I once again contacted the bank and was lucky to have someone assigned to me that said "" I dont think it's right to have your name on something you dont have access to"" and I was finally able to have a banking card send to me in Germany and online banking set up. 
So I was able to receive the money in November. My exhusband then contacted the bank and said it was fraud and they send a credit while they we're investigating the issue. I called them right away and told them it was me that did it and they took the credit back. Now the problem was that because he said it was fraud my card got deactivated and a new one send out. Of course because of the holidays I wasnt expecting much and the card wasnt there at the end of december. So the money from dfas came and he took it right away putting the account at 0,00$. Okay great I thought from now on it will be a game on who is faster but I still wanted to know If my card was on the way so I contacted the bank and got told that he closed the account and when the new card arrives i can just cut it up and dispose it.

I am exhausted and really dont know what to do anymore.


One thing I always wanted to know is if the dfas is able to send money to a German bank account since I dont have a SSN to open up another American Bank Account.

Army,"Reservist, in IRR. Recently spoke to my career counselor just to keep in touch and update info.

They mentioned recruiting as an AGR recruiter. I’ve been giving it some thought and itd be nice to have full time bennies. Only conundrum I have is my current civ job is pretty nice. I get paid good, have solid benefits relative to civilian jobs that don’t require a degree. I work 4 8s so get 3 days off every week. Always possible to pick up overtime and there is a near zero chance I lose my job due to economic down turn(business has been operating 60 years and has been growing since). Always home by 4 or earlier. It’s not a job I’d like to make a career out of because I’ll be pretty broken by the time I’m 35.

My question is what’s the day to day like for a recruiter on the Reserve side? Are you more stressed than your AD counterparts, are your requirements harder or easier to achieve?

Army,"I acquired a soldier in 2013 fresh out of reclassing. I gave her an initial counseling the day she came to me. 

A month later, I gave her a monthly counseling and stated because she was not technically proficient, I wasn’t recommending her for that month’s promotion board. You’d have thought I told her she’d never go to the board. 

She waited 3 months for me to go on TDY to Polk for 30 days. She then went to the post CSM and told him she’d never been counseled. She had 4 counseling statements she signed in her packet. The post CSM called my brigade and demanded my counseling packet for her. I came back from Polk and my other troops rushed to me to tattle on her. 

I went to my BN CSM and told him what was up. He asked to see her packet. I gave it to him, he told the platoon sergeant to counsel her for lying on an NCO. The only counseling she was missing was my TDY, which I couldn’t counsel her because I didn’t witness her. He told me to add a memo to her packet I was TDY and have my NCOIC give her a monthly. 

She then decided an EO complaint would be the route to go. I was standing in PT formation when one of my Joes said, “I’m thinking of going natural.” I replied, “I think you’d look great!” 

I go to 0900 work call. EO walks up to me telling me she got a funny report about me. Then she asked if I told PFC X she’d look good with natural hair. I admitted I did. She said, “That’s it. That’s the report. I’m not going to do anything with it.” And walked away. 

She was the worst soldier I’ve ever encountered. Rather than prove to me she could do her job at the rate of an NCO, she proved she was petty and childish and deserved to wear that sham shield. I certainly wasn’t promoting her ahead of my super star soldiers who excelled at their job while she didn’t even know how to fill out basic forms. 

I ended up PCS’ing to Cuba and last I heard, she was still a SPC.

Army,"I just purchased this jacket in honor of the closest thing I ever had to a father. He was army special forces airborne and my little sisters biological father. He would often take me on the weekend at 4:00 a.m. to ""Jump Zone"" as he called it here in the deserts of Arizona. Growing up without a father and having him in my life we're the best moments of my childhood. He taught me how to fight, how to shoot, He even taught me how to sword fight in both Kendo and Fencing styles. His name was Michael Barber, and unfortunately he passed away during a parachuting accident. He was doing a stunt for the Bruce Willis movie ""Tears of the Sun"".
He was hit by a gust of wind and got wrapped in his chute and fell into the ocean. I just hope with his expertise he understood his situation and was able to find peace on his way down. The only way I can comfort myself about the situation is knowing he went out doing what he loved most....And hoping it was somehow peaceful and quick 😞

Anyway I don't know much about his rank, or even his time served. But as soon as I saw this jacket I knew I had to buy it. I've been thinking A LOT about him as I recently just got back into firearms training and he was the one who first taught me how to shoot. So I remember everything I can about his lessons and it's actually been quite helpful even all these years later. I know that he trained troops for Saudi Arabia, or trained troops in Saudi Arabia... I'm not sure if they were actual Saudi troops or not. I remember him telling me he actually spent a lot of time and Saudi civilian clothing because he could pass as Saudi Arabian. I think he also worked with the Mujahideen because he would talk a lot about them and he showed me how to sneak around in the mountains like they did. Sorry I've gotten WAAAY of topic. 

To anyone still reading thank you very much for allowing me to reminisce. 

If anyone has any information on this style of camouflage I would greatly appreciate it. Sorry for the long tangent. And Thanks again for anyone who has read this and is willing to help.

I will have completed my MSO in May '24 and submitted my UQR to leave in June '24.

However this year the unit is supposed to get TCS orders to do something irrelevant to our actual job as a Battalion at a stateside installation in August for a year. I have a great job that I just took that will propel my career and income upward.

I've been pretty vocal that I will not join the unit when they go, as I submitted a UQR but so are many of the other officers who want to go IRR or trying to get out of it (some are still within their MSO).


Got a new BC I haven't spoke to yet due to the limited time at BA and the holidays but I've notified the previous BN CDR and the HHC CDR for their knowledge when I submitted the packet for S1. As far as I know no one has been interviewed as to explain why they can't go as well as a roster scrub hasn't been conducted for whos going.


I've looked up AR 135-175 and the Request for Resignation Unqualified sharepoint  and can't find the answer whether if I can still UQR if whatever reason I get orders or if I'm even eligible to get orders because my MSO ends in May.


I'm sort of sweating and obviously being a reservist with the holidays I have to wait for certain answers. So I wanted to see if anyone has recommendations, input, experience, or an answer in the meanwhile

Army,"I am currently in infantry OSUT to become an 11c; however, I have been having some hearing difficulties, which include lots of ringing, things  aren’t as loud as they used to be, and inner ear pain. Now, I'm at the point where people’s voices are muffled, but I can still understand them, but sometimes it's hard. Prior to going on HBL, I went to a sick call about it, and I was told that I had H3 hearing and that I was disqualified from doing infantry or any combat MOS. I should also mention that at MEPS, I failed the hearing test and was put in the category of H3 and received a waiver for it. Now the thing is, in her notes, she says a reclass is needed, and she set me up with an appointment with the audiologist to consult with and figure out if I need hearing aids and do another evaluation when I come back from HBL. I imagine that's the final nail in the coffin for me because there is not a chance in hell I pass that hearing test, especially not now. I did a hearing test and evaluation here with an audiologist in my hometown, and based on the testing and speech test, his recommendation was that I should switch to a job with less noise exposure before it gets worse. I really want to stay in the army, and I am just confused about how this whole process works in BCT/OSUT. I am also worried that there is a chance I might get discharged, which I hope not, but I really don’t know at this point. My drill sergeant told me that the army would rather retain me and work with me to get me a different MOS than discharge me. But again, I have no clue. So I am wondering: am I at the needs of the army, do I get to choose, or is it a random job? I heard supply is needed really badly. Are my job options limited due to my hearing, and am I going to be on some hearing profile? Also, with my hearing, am I disqualified from doing certain military schools, and if I really wanted to do said military schools, how would that work?",How does a medical reclass in BCT/OSUT work?,[],r/army,0.6739347389220144,-0.27735798211020646,-0.27735798211020646,0,1,0,0,0,Whole-Grade-5676,-0.4540574096615417,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,7,0

Army,"Hello everyone, 

Gonna be a long post, so want to apologize in advance. So I made SGT two months before I ETS’d. I had already signed a contract with the National Guard as a SPC before getting promoted and wasn’t able to get a SGT slot at the time, so I was stuck as a SPC. I didn’t like the Guard at all so I decided to return to Active Duty. I was initially told that I should be able to return as a SGT, but when it came time to sign my contract I was informed that I would have to as a SPC without receiving a clear reason as to why. I decided to sign the contract and try to figure out why when I returned to Active Duty. After speaking with some senior leaders in my unit, the general consensus was that I failed to meet the remaining service requirement for SGT to be able to keep that rank. At first, I accepted that as a logical answer and accepted the fact that I’ll have to go through the process again to make SGT. It wasn’t until a few months later when I stumbled upon AR 600-8-19 (Should have prefaced by saying that I tried searching through regs on my own to find an answer but never did) which stated that there is no service remaining required for promotion to SSG and below.

Army," 

Long post ahead of feeling sorry for myself, but I have to vent.

My ETS is in January of 2026.

I am so damn sick and tired of being in the military and the Army I don't know what to do. I've been diagnosed with adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depressed mood, but I probably have worse problems with my head than that.

I am a shit bag soldier. I'll admit it. I enlisted way older than what I should have joined. Wish I had joined the Air Force but I would have been a shitbag there too, but at least I wouldn't have to worry about the field, group PT, staying in the barracks as an unmarried E4, etc. I have one of the worst jobs in the military, tried to reclass, and failed my reclass, now I'm back to the MOS I tried to escape from.

I've been in since October of 2017. Six years now. Despite getting a company grade article 15 in May of 2018 (smoked in the barracks) I was somehow considered decent enough at my first unit to be given a specialist waiver at my 18 month mark, May of 2019. I haven't been in trouble since then but I'm still a shitbag. I have been a specialist since then.

My next unit (interpost transfer) basically screwed me over repeatedly and just neglected me. Even the first sergeant knew what was going on, so coming to him wasn't going to do a damn thing. Didn't even process my PCS award and when I asked for it, they said ""you'll get it."" They never did process it.

I was told at my three year mark when I was in Greece that I would go to the promotion board. That came and went and I never did go. My last six months at my unit before I reenlisted, I was given AT LEAST SEVEN non-recommendation counsellings and was passed around to a new E5 almost every month, who would then tell me that I hadn't been under them long enough to be recommended. I would have been sent to at least one more E5 if I hadn't left my unit when I did, because my last E5 was getting out. One staff sergeant I had told me ""just because you've been in for over four years, doesn't mean you should go to the board"", and then my retention sergeant told me that that E6 came to him and asked if there was a way to bar me from reenlistment.

Over four and a half years of being a specialist now, and I have still never been recommended for the promotion board.

All these people who were E2's, and even people who weren't even in the Army when I joined, are now E5's while I'm still an unpromatable E4.    I know there's people who've been in for six years who are now E6's or E5 promotables, while I'm still an unpromotable E4 after over four and a half years time in grade and six years time in service.  Whatever.   I get it, there's something very, very wrong with ME, and this just isn't for me. I was trying to reclass so I could have something to fall back one when I got out, and I was trying to reclass to something that was a little ""less Army"" but that blew up in my pathetic face.

**I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of my MOS, I'm tired of the military, and I am just tired of the Army.** I still have nightmares about bad experiences I've had (being in a group of trainees in basic where one guy broke his neck, being with a guy on my MOS with a fire and watching him get burned, myself being burned by an asshole who wasn't paying attention and then blamed me, being grabbed in the balls on duty from behind, etc.. and I still think about failing my AIT when I tried to reclass.)

Now I just show up at the right place and time and uniform and that's it now.

The military and the Army with the morning PT, barracks, field, etc. just isn't for me. I can't wait to just get the fuck out. Take my honorable discharge and just go. If I never do make sergeant, then whatever.  Fuck this. I was told a few years ago ""you'll never be a NCO, never. And ""you don't deserve to be in the Army"" That's fine now. I don't care anymore. All I care about now is finishing my time and preparing to get out.   

I don't want to try to reclass again because for one, I don't want to deal with the extra stupid rules the Army has on even prior service, ON TOP of the general military nonsense (It pissed me off when I had prior service Air Force guys tell me they didn't have to stay in barracks and they did PT on their own, while we prior service Army still had to stay in barracks and do PT and deal with random formations called upon by drill sergeants even in the evening over stupid shit somebody else did.) and 2), I don't want to risk failing the AIT and then I'm RIGHT BACK to my MOS.

Army,"So, recently I re-enlisted in the NG while deployed, I was in the Kuwait/Jordan Area, and I was re-assured that my bonus would be tax free. I re-enlisted under the idea that I would get a lump sum payment, and that sounded good to me. The bonus was 20k in total.  


Clearly I am posting here cause was because I didn't get 20k. Now, to be fair to the Guard, the total was 20k, truly a lump sum payment. However I am wondering how I might resolve 2 things:  
1: 3k of it went straight to my TSP. I didn't even think that my TSP would take some, and I'm not against putting some in there, but I'm not wanting to put 3k in. I don't get the payout for a few days, can I go ahead and adjust my TSP today and then receive more in hand, OR is it solidified cause I see it in MyPay? How can I go about getting those funds if so?  


2: I got taxed nearly 5k, which, I heard happens. I've heard varied responses such as, ""Submit a copy of your orders/your re-enlistment orders/bonus to finance and wait for your 5k back,"" to, ""You gotta wait till tax time, you'll get it back,"" which because my payout is the 4th of Jan, won't be till next year.

Army,"I leave for fort Jackson Feb 5 for fat camp. I have a few questions

1. My recruiter told me theArmy was phasing in a new tape method, and with the new method I'm within body fat standards but when I went to MEPS  in Amarillo they used the old tape method which I'm out of standards by 3%. When I brought up the new tape method they just said ""we use the 3 site method"" and kinda acted like I was talking crazy so I just shut up about it. And now I'm going to fat camp. --  the question here is what method are they using in fort Jackson?  Just the whole ""once you make bf you can jump into a basic if it's before your 90 days"" is causing some stress as I'd like to know exact dates. And the fact that even if I make bf I'll be stuck waiting on a sooner basic date. Plus kinda sucks that I worked my ass off to make tape using the new method to still be over with the old method.

2. What do I pack? Is it pretty much the same as basic list my recruiter gave me? Do I pack more hygiene? 

3. What's it like?

Army,I’m coming up on the end of a somewhat hostile (not actively engaging forces) deployment. I’ve seen very little things that haven’t phased me whatsoever but I have loved the excitement and the feeling of WE have a mission against hostile people. I’ve thought and contemplated going home and what I will do and feel and i’ve honestly just come to the conclusion that going home doesn’t sound excited and I don’t miss home all that much i’m sure it’s probably normal i’m just kind of worried about what to do when I get home. when I have my wife and dogs that i’ve missed so much but now it just feels like “meh yea we’re going home oh well”.

Army,"Hey hi howdy! Another long post!

&amp;#x200B;

I am not a very holiday oriented person. I legitimately forget holidays are coming up and could not tell you the date of any holiday besides probably July 5th (Huehue). But there is one holiday I never forget, and it could maybe be because it's literally impossible. Like you may forget how many inches are on a ruler, but you definitely know what number it starts with; 0. That's New Years. I fucking love New Years, it a hard set date that marks time progressing forward. Each year is a race to try and do as much as possible before the end of that 20– number. It gets me in this weird philosophical mindset where I dread and embrace the passage of time. Something about changing the year I wrote by muscle memory all year as it was unchanging and concrete, the old one being one I will never write with the same mentality ever again.

&amp;#x200B;

The year that was once the mark of cutting edge modernity,

“um It is literally 2023,  how are we still doing this, get with the times 💅”

&amp;#x200B;

Becomes old, dated, and represents some defining moment of that year we are now moving forward from, moving on. It's now 2024 and we are barreling towards a new great defining moment that we can't predict or plan for.  What's going to be the Defining Moment for humanity? the moment for America? What's going to be the Defining Moment for you?

&amp;#x200B;

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

&amp;#x200B;

I am still a baby faced innocent young man of 23, so years aren't zooming by yet. These things take forever to pass. And I feel like I am a different person at the end of each one. But this year in particular has been the most unending, mindwarpingly, soul-testingly long 365 days of my life. I cannot put it in my head that so much happened in this year, it feels like 4. Every month I am a whole new person, and often at a whole new place in life it seems. I used to do posts here only after every significant developments and achievements happened, but it got to a point that if I kept that up, I'd be posting every week or twice a week and nobody wants that.

&amp;#x200B;

Both to help me get the story straight in my head and to send off the craziest year of my life, here's a wrap up of my 2023. What's yours?

&amp;#x200B;

**THE BEGINNING OF MY YEAR.**

&amp;#x200B;

*One of the most challenging and awful months of my life. I will explain it in extreme detail because it was incredibly difficult and I never posted openly about all of it. Covers me almost dying, me creating the first real army bone marrow program, me joining the boss executive council and getting fired from the executive council.*

&amp;#x200B;

**January 1st -** Started my job with the Bliss BOSS executive council along with two others, we were all collectively going to fully replace the current council.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 15th** \- [I began a two week long marrow donor registry drive at WBAMC.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/10ixiaa/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_22_yo_spc_currently/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Sourced soldiers to help from my brigade CSM who gave me 6 from different units each day. I did two shifts with 3 in the morning and three in the afternoon, 14 hours total each day. Each day I had to train, manage, and watch the team.  As well as source and ensure I had my team for the next day. I was walking well over 8 miles a day between all my tables and averaging 70+ calls a day managing the team, hospital staff, and sourcing, while also doing my job with BOSS remotely.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 25th -** I did a local news interview, as well as an interview with Army Magazine. Right after I started feeling sick. Progressively getting worse until I had to spend the last 4 hours of the day passed out on a table in an empty conference room I had claimed as my HQ. That same week my [taskandpurpose article](https://www.reddit.com/user/BlissBoneMarrowGuy/comments/10gnj08/task_and_purpose/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) came out finally. It was a big week.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 26th -**  I woke up that morning ungodly sick, I absolutely could not speak.  I texted and told one of my trusted guys that he is going to have to handle today on his own. I wasn't going to make it in. I texted my POC for the hospital, a MSG who reached out on Reddit and made the whole detail possible and let her know. She told me I was dumb if I did not go to the ER and get some meds. I was literally vomiting phlegm every couple minutes and had a 105 temperature and getting worse. I was completely delirious and managed to barely text one of my friends to take me to the E.R. Within an hour I was on a breathing tube and getting emergency surgery. I was just told they were removing my tonsils and draining the extreme swelling. It was so bad they had to put the tube in while I was awake, then immediately put me to sleep.

&amp;#x200B;

**January 30th -** [I woke up in the ICU covered in tubes and bruises.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/10qevmd/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_another_post_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I was told I had the worst case of a very rare case of tonsillitis called periodontal tonsillitis they'd ever seen. I would have died that day from my throat closing up had I not gone to the E.R. when I did. It took 6 people to hold me down to get the tube in and I almost bit through it, as well as the surgeon's finger when he tried to pry my mouth open. They almost had to do a chest trach. They also had lost my phone in the struggle when it was launched across the room. Took two days for them to find it and my friends and partner having no clue what happened to me. I lost 17 pounds and had acquired some extreme body dysmorphia and muscle dystrophy. My number two guy who I had basically abandoned with only a “you gotta handle today” 5 days prior had continued on with running the hospital drive in my place with no further information from me or any clue what happened. He handled the final two days with no supply refills and no way to actually contact the next day's detail members. But he did what he could. That drive registered 685 people and more than tripled the previous records for hospital registry drives in military history.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 2nd -** I leave the hospital and have to go right back to work. Having learned while I was being recognized by the CG the next day, and going through every drug withdrawal on the planet at the time from what the hospital had me on. It was a rough day. Spent all night sick, achey, and with massive mood swings from the steroid shot withdrawals. Barely fell asleep 2 hours before my wake up time.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 3rd -** Woke up early, got in trouble with the BOSS council for missing my up-text by 3 minutes. I had to make a huge power move today, I almost died and with that, all my efforts gone to nothing. Before today my work was only ever a hobby, with no real goal of where to go with it. [I spent 6 hours that morning typing up and designing a 37 page continuity book, finding a printer, binder, and page protector. I finished minutes before the ceremony, and when the CG gave me my ARCOM, I gave him a challenge coin and the continuity book right back.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/12jtz4k/spc_awards_1st_armoured_divisions_2_star/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Saying “With this you can make Fort Bliss the center of marrow donations for the Army for decades to come” and requested a contact at division to help make this effort permanent. He told me he has a division surgeon cell that may be qualified.

I wobbled back home, almost passing out every other step from how weak I was. I expected nothing to come from this.

&amp;#x200B;

**February 16th -** [Today I was invited to attend the ironclad meeting. Basically every single commander and CSM on post gathers each month in one building.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13ie3jo/bone_marrow_guy_of_fort_bliss_fort_bliss_is/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I was there to award them this huge sculpted wood femur bone trophy I had been making for almost a year for their (my) achievements for donations. I had gotten no further information from the CG so I had another power move ready to go. My killer right hand man from the hospital drive agreed to help me get ready. We assembled 5 more binders of continuity books and planned to hand them out in the wide open to every medical officer right in front of the division leadership. I expected nothing to come from this either. We were scrambling around trying to buy the stuff. I was at the PX frowning over binder prices and we was off at a print shop when I got a call from the division surgeon cell SGM. He told me they were tasked to work with me to create the OPORD for making my continuity book a full program across Fort Bliss. I dropped to the floor in the middle of the shoppette. We finished the books, awarded the trophy and went on with our day. Once I got in my car later to go get a beer and celebrate it all hit me, and I spent the entire drive and a long time in the parking lot screaming, punching the steering wheel and crying tears of joy for the first time in my life. It was all worth it. All my pain and losses and illness. Once I got my health back, I began obsessing over the gym and eating. Putting on 20 pounds in 3 weeks and eating over 4K calories a day to get back what I lost. I had bought dress pants, chinos and such, after I got out the hospital when I was still dilapidatley skinny for my job at BOSS and put so much muscle on my butt and thighs so quickly I popped the buttons off or tore the back pockets of every single pair of those pants.

&amp;#x200B;

**February - March -** I began building my OPORD for the program with the division surgeon. Pouring my self entirely into my job at BOSS. Obsessing over finding and networking businesses to work with us to have consistent and long term volunteer events with unique places of need within the city. Special needs schools, nursing homes, movie nights at homeless shelters, soul kitchens and pantrys, etc. as well as chess clubs around the city, D&amp;D nights, horse riding, and other things. I wanted the soldiers who never leave the barracks to join events that fit their interests.

&amp;#x200B;

I learned excel and rebuilt [the backend tracking system for BOSS](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13lb194/i_redesigned_the_fort_bliss_boss_programs_entire/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to allow us to track which brigades are signing up for events and which are not, located and tied in every BOSS rep since the system was completely out of date, and developed ways to keep these reps accountable for ensuring soldiers know about our events.

&amp;#x200B;

**March 16th -** had to get my left shoulder totally reconstructed. My arm and years old grappling injuries and new army injuries had caused it to start dislocating in my sleep. It dislocated around 23 times in the year since I had been at Bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

**April -** recovery from surgery, personal losses. Personal Struggles and professional differences with the new president of BOSS. Feeling like it was time to let BoneMarrowGuy die since there was no further I could go. I was making a division wide permanent program and that's as far as my potential to make a difference. Maybe other divisions will follow, maybe not.

&amp;#x200B;

Towards the end of the month I was facing down serious burnout from everything, those differences at work were so bad I was beginning to document every single things I did every day to the minute. Every conversation and task completed or progressed or failed. I couldn't figure it out and just dived more into even more of a OCD routine to make it work. I was smoking a pack of black and mild's and two beers a day as my only vice.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 2nd -** I was facing down serious burnout, I was making plans to take advantage of a three day weekend to get a bunch of friends and get an AirBnb in the mountain forest two hours away and just take a rest. That day I had invited two great friends to join me and some others to come up. I hadn't kept nearly as close as I should have with them but they told me they wanted to start hanging out again. Two roommates who were absolutely inseparable, literally together 24/7 or on the phone. That night I was at my partners house and got a call from my NCO asking if I was okay, because there were a bunch of MPs and an ambulance at the barracks. I figured another rowdy combat engineer night or someone burned a pizza again. Or maybe something else.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 3rd -** At 1300 I got curious and called a friend of mine while at work. I casually asked “was it a suicide” he said yes and I asked with disconnected attention if he knew who. He said it was my friend, the one I had spoken to yesterday. I fuckin ran out of the office and immediately started calling trying to figure out where her friend was. I got a hold of their 1SG and was told she was in the hospital and would be back soon. I went to the store and bought every goddamn grocery, cooked days of meal prep and waited until I was told she got back and dropped it all off at her door.

&amp;#x200B;

**May 4th -** that night I stayed up all night with a SSG from my company talking to him about how to deal with it. I had a mason jar with the fanciest rum drink on the planet, chopped up fruit garnish everything. I finally went to bed at 4AM with it untouched next to me. Overslept by hours because my phone had died with my partner on the line. Woke up to a knock at my door, it was the BOSS president. I was fired an hour later by phone call.

&amp;#x200B;

I went up to cloud Croft that weekend with a bunch of friends and reset. Grieved, paid my respects and came back an entirely new man. I was ready and excited to come back to my company. I was now deploying in 2 months, **July 15th.**

&amp;#x200B;

OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

&amp;#x200B;

Rebirth of Bone Guy.

&amp;#x200B;

I started diving right back into this effort. Any time I went through a struggle this things was always there for me. I wanted to help others do more drives and spent my time getting ready for deployment and building up a team of volunteers across the Army.

&amp;#x200B;

**June 28th -** I met with Mario Terenas, the former 10th Mountain division CSM and now deputy chief of AUSA’s Center for Leadership. We were connected through the journalist for Army Magazine who had become a dear friend of mine. That call changed my entire perspective for this efforts possibility. It didn't just end at Bliss for me. It could and WILL be an Army wide program. He invited me to attend the AUSA national conference and made dozens of promises to introduce me to important leaders in the mean time. He asked for the products I had so he could show them off. I had none lol.

&amp;#x200B;

I had to decide. Do I deploy or pursue this opportunity. I joined the Army so I could see more of the world than my little ghetto I grew up in. This was my only chance. Everyone I knew was going. Or do I try and stay, make another sacrifice for the pipedream of chasing this. Could I really make an army wide program? I chose to roll the dice. I planned for weeks for this meeting. We went on spring block leave and I spent the entire time at my computer preparing. Networking, creating products, researching, and planning for one big power move. An open door with my brigade CSM to convince him that this is worth pursuing. Or maybe he will convince me it's not.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 1st -** [my Army magazine article comes out.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14w32bi/im_in_the_army_magazine/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

J**uly 6th -** I met with my CSM. 8 days from my flight date. His first day back from block leave. I had everything he could say and my perfect answer prewritten and memorized. I had a big SITREP typed up with a timeline plan blocked out for the rest of the year leading to the conference. I was ready. It was just supposed to be a brief about my efforts, but it quickly segued into “how would this deployment affect it.” “Greatly CSM” and 7 minutes later I was officially staying. He just had to figure out where. My MOS was being dropped from my brigade so I wasn't going to have a job either way.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 12th -** I met with CSM Light, the 1AD CSM for the first time. He read over my SITREP and plan, and listened carefully to everything I had to say. He told me my place was right here at division and he would have me moved shortly. He just didn't know where to fit me yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**July 15th -** My Flight date for my deployment passes me by. I remain right where I was at. Now Rear-D for 2nd BDE

&amp;#x200B;

I basically existed without a unit for the next month. I got my tonsils removed and spent all my week days with a self assigned 9-8 work schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

**August 7th -** the day I got my ability to speak back I began meeting with every unit in post and planning one of the largest bone marrow donor registry drives in Army history. Every unit in bliss.

&amp;#x200B;

**August 14-19th -** I got a detail of soldiers dedicated to helping me. [Went to 22 battalions over these 5 days running registry events. 2-5 a day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/15qxo61/the_fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_the_largest_donor/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**August 22nd -** I started my first day at my new company. Running the orderly room for division.

&amp;#x200B;

[I went to the field, learned my job. Began working to fix the rosters for division while still networking and helping my team get events done and meetings done.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/14xwg97/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_operation_ring_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**September -** Every waking moment of my life. 19 hours a day 7 days a week of dedicated to transforming this from a hobby to a full fledged program. Building a Google share drive that would allow every single person who wants to get involved to have premade tools, walkthroughs, presentations, resources, and guides for everything they could possibly need.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**October 8th-12th -** [We went to the conference.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/18dw2am/fort_bliss_bone_marrow_guy_how_a_bunch_of/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) Met with almost every army leader imaginable. Pitching our program to every leader from the division level to the Chief of Staff. [Passing out a hundred one-page hitters and 65 wooden SPC coins that were my business cards.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/175wjzy/i_spent_every_minute_of_the_army_national/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

&amp;#x200B;

**October 14th -** Visited the Salute to Life Labs and learned everything about the process of extracting HLA typing from samples. Got every bit of mystery removed from the process.

&amp;#x200B;

Spent the weekend hanging out in DC with my best friend who drove up. One of the best Saturday club nights of my life lol.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 18th -** Flew back home and hours later went to the field.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 25th -** Debriefed the CSM and he decided he wanted me to do this full time. Moving me into the G6 section of division HQ.

&amp;#x200B;

**October 30th -** began working at G6 Help desk

&amp;#x200B;

\-Got a random phone call from the SMA office. Didn't know they were allowed to do that. The SMA wanted to follow up on my work, and wanted to know how he could help. Was told MEDCOM would be reaching out soon.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the month of November is me doing meetings, calls, scheduling trips and planning out the new year and it's trips and meetings.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 28th -** ArmyTimes article comes out.

&amp;#x200B;

**November 1st -** Got moved to G6s VTC section because it lined up better with my work schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**November 4th -** MEDCOM called me.

&amp;#x200B;

**December 7th -** moved to the division surgeon cell to now fully run this program with guidance from staff officers. The first 25s to ever be attached to the surgeon cell. The first ever SPC to work in that office. Ever confused. I wasn't even a part of the conversation. Just got told the day I got back.

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the month is just meetings meetings meetings I can't post about just yet. I don't like to post uncertainties or things in progress you know what i mean? ;)

&amp;#x200B;

This has been the absolute hardest year of my life. I cannot cope with the amount of loss and gain and growth and success and failures I've experienced in such a short time. This doesn't even cover all of it. I really cannot wrap my head around how much has happened in so little time. One year, and enough to fit a whole career. How do I fit all of this into my identity? How can I get any of the ego I have to have for what all is coming next when all of that success is marked by so much loss and failure and sacrifice to get there? I don't know. But I cannot bring into words how much this community means to me in its support and encouragement. So many times I've felt totally lost, and I could just dive back into this community and this work and find myself again.

Shoutouts to some of the realest Homies on the sub. There are a ton of people who I want to shout-out but these active users are such great parts of what makes this community so amazing to be a part of.

Army,"I’m a 21 year old dude and I’ve been strongly considering enlisting. 

As a general background I’ll be starting my last semester of college soon, and after that will be graduating with a degree in Sport Management. 

For a variety of reasons I feel like I chose the wrong degree. However my mistake has left me with 25k in debt. My plan prior to considering enlisting (a recent idea) was to move back home with my parents and work off my debt until I can become financially independent. 

But now at 21, I want to get out of the house and get on with life. However I will soon have a degree I don’t want that only affords me jobs I don’t want to work. My home environment is terrific and I have wonderful parents, but I feel “trapped” due to my situation and don’t see how I’m going to get out. The other issue is I don’t know what I want and feel like I lack purpose 

For this reason I see three options:

1- apply and look for jobs using this degree that I don’t want, work said job long enough to get out of the house, and get rid of my debt then decide what to do

2- go to grad school, take on more debt, use the advanced degree to get a job closer to what I want (which I don’t know). This decision I feel like is going to leave me in the same situation as I am now but just delay it by a few years

3- Enlist. Live as cost minimum as possible, serve my country (fulfilling the need for a purpose), pay off debt, open job opportunities within the service 

I just want some advice. Is my decision making misguided?

How do I keep my guys heads up and let them know it’s not gonna be the end of the world? Also what’s this training gonna be like? I hear it’s all different details but that’s about it. Thanks

Army,"Trying to become an officer at almost 35

Hi everyone. I am a male, 34 years old; I'll be turning 35 in a couple of months. I've had some familiarity with the military since an early age. My stepdad retired from the US Army as an E-8 in aviation. While we lived in the States, I was forced to join the JROTC (to gain some discipline at the time). I did it for a year, and after we moved abroad. I've been moving from place to place since then. I am looking at going back to the States and settling.

I hold a US Bachelor's degree in Philosophy and Psychology. And I have two Master's, both from a Spanish university online. One is in Education, and the other one in UX-Design. My GPA in all my degrees ranges from 2.4-2.8.

My career has developed mostly in language teaching. I am considering the option of becoming an officer either in the US Army or USAF. In the Army, I am a good fit for a Human Resources Officer, and in the USAF, I could potentially be an Intel Officer ( I did not find an HR officer on their website.

I am currently abroad, so I can't visit a recruiter. I am physically able to score 100 on the PT in both branches; however, I am approximately 30lb overweight for my age group. I'm 5'10'' with 220lb.

Also, I don't have any tattoos; however, I have a couple on my bucket list, and I might get them this year.

I would really appreciate any suggestions on how to approach this goal.

Army,"Hello,
Not sure if this topic falls under here, it’s my first time posting on Reddit.

  I’ve been enlisted in the Army for almost 2 years now and I’ve been actively thinking about quitting. 
It’s not that I’m in a shitty unit or that my NCOs treat me horribly, I have a medical condition that makes me non deployable (I can’t attend training in order to make me deployable) and I’m looking forward to a life of gate guard and arms room. It’s terribly frustrating because I was looking forward to the opportunities I’ll get, but got my physicals back just to be disappointed. I believe it would get better with time (maybe), but the way everyone else is treating my non deployable status makes me want to quit and discourages me to go on. The thing is if I got stationed in a unit that doesn’t require any previous training in order to deploy it wouldn’t have mattered, but since this unit needs this class, now I’m just a shit bag getting all the jobs that nobody wants.

  Another reason I want out is that my fiancé is stationed far from me and simply is hard to balance plane tickets and bills to see each other often. We have been considering the fact I get moved to a unit at their station after getting married, but from what I’ve heard it’s a gamble since we’re both active. 

  I wanted to propose the fact that I have no use in this unit if I can’t deploy (since this unit is on a constant rotation) and if they could somehow move me if we get married, but I’m not sure how this process works or if I would fall in my favor. 
Between balancing my health, mental health, and anxiety it has been rough past 6 months and started my new years depressed. 

The best result would be moving to a unit at my fiancé’s station and living together and staying in the army till my contract is up, but if that’s not possible I want out. 

  My room mate had thrown out the suggestion of failing ACFT, but I feel like that wouldn’t work so well. My other friend suggested going to BH again and explain everything I’ve been going through and get separation papers that way, but I don’t know if my reasons would be valid enough for that.
I’m not exactly sure what I’m trying to ask, but I’m just burned out and want to be with someone that wants to be with me and needs me. Is failing PT test or BH really the method to go? Would getting married warrant me a change of duty stations? I know there’s no way of avoiding hate and shitty jokes about how I’m trash and a quitter but at this point no matter what I do I’m no use to the unit and am trash anyways. I just want to know how the process would look like.

I’ve been struggling with anxiety before my first year and have been to medical to talk about it and get anxiety med. I struggled from constant nightmares every night that woke me up at night and couldn’t go back to sleep. I still have anxiety attacks during my sleep and would wake up in uncontrollable sobs. I’ve had some experiences before the army that makes me constantly anxious and thought joining would be a great way to fix it and escape the environment I was in. It did help me escape the environment but I still carry anxiety from memories that would sometimes feel too real. I considered ending it all multiple times then to constantly live with doubts and fears, but my fiancé is the one who stopped me. Those fears didn’t stop because of my them or anything, but whenever I’m with them I know there’s always someone who’s got my back and is willing to calm me down when I’m going down in a spiral. My whole life I’ve been living catering to people and I know that’s just life in a sense, but I’m just tired of ignoring how I feel in order to please some people that doesn’t care about me with this whole system of ranks and brownie points. I joined to belong and to find a sense of purpose to my life filled with hatred and lost, but I don’t think I’ll find it here.   All I’ve experienced here was favoritism and people who doesn’t have a sense of moral or purpose (the amount of drinking and wanting to have intimacy while being married or in a relationship is insane makes me depressed).

Army,"Have you checked the HRC trends report for your MOS?  HRC periodically issues statistics not simply on the promotion point cut-off score for each MOS for promotion to SGT and SSG, but also publishes a look at the distribution of eligible soldiers by their current promotion points.  The attached chart is created from one of these HRC reports: SSG\_SGT-Eligibles-Trend-Report with the most recent being dated 4 DEC 2023.

In the chart, ranges of promotion points are shown on the horizontal axis (e.g. 24-49 points).  The bars represent a count of the SSG eligible soldiers and show the actual number above the bar.

If you are working towards promotion, this will give a clearer sense of where you stand relative to others in your MOS on promotion points.  Then you can strategize on ways to strengthen your position or to coach your soldiers.

As context using 11B, the SSG promo points cut-off for Oct, Nov, and Dec was 360, 357, and 396 points, respectively.  Also, in Dec 2023, there are 1220 SSG eligibles developing and moving towards promotion.  The average point score is 287 and average cut-off score over recent months is 365.

How does the distribution strike you?

Can I get Ranger School after OSUT?

Hello, I am currently enlisting in the army national guard as an 11b. I’m curious if I could get ranger school after osut. I saw that one of the newer recruits got it and he went to ranger school, air assault school and airborne school straight after osut.

Getting ready to go see a recruiter for the Army, anything I should keep in mind.

Background, i’m 16, in highschool, and i’ve been very interested in the service my whole life. I’m not bad at school, my grades are very good and i’m in all advance classes. I’m considered a lot of things and a lot of options. Being an 18 series has been on the table for me, but i’ve also always been very into human ecology and more specifically the way humans interact with each other. So that led to me into checking out HUMINT. I don’t know much, pretty little actually and I’m planning to talk to a recruiter about all of this and just want to make sure I know what I need to know going into it. Thanks!

Im in high school right now and I have plans to join the military soon when I join 18. I been doing a lot of research since I know this is what I want to do and I am stuck on either trying to become a Ranger or enlist as a 35L (Counter Intelligence Agent). If you have served as either or have an opinion of which I should choose, please let me know because they both seem like good options in the long run.

I'm about to start my 6th week of basic training, and I love the Army so far. I'm looking to really protect and serve my country, but I fear I'll be recycled if I don't meet the Army standards for the upcoming 7-mile ruck we all have after HBL or if I don't pass the next ACFT. Even if I get recycled, as long as I do not quit, they won't kick me out, right?

I'll continue pushing. I don't know how long it takes, but I just worry they'll give up on me. I hear a lot of people say the Army doesn't care about you, and I refuse to believe in that. I just want to succeed in this.

Almost set on going 11X, I am overweight (25% BF) | need discipline, I plan to only do 4 years as 11 series to see if I enjoy it. What should I be expecting/looking to get out of it?
I heard people while I was at MEPs saying there doing their airborne physical, but to be honest I could care less if I was airborne or not, I am more interested in getting the discipline / benefits out of it etc. I mean arctic or mountain would be coool tabs.
Anyways, should I expect a bonus/airborne option? (never asked my recruiter about it cuz I figured I wasn't qualified due to weight)

It's no secret that 15W and 15E Shadow UAV community are about to be restructured and reorganized in a way that could mean reducing and reclassing many soldiers. I've seen several post for advice on forced reclassing pop up and think it would be beneficial for a stickied post to be created. Give the Shadow guys a place to discuss the future of the MOS along with advice on what to do going forward.

Also, any advice on being reclassed? How the process starts and about how many offerings they give? Asking for a friend...

I’m 17 and planning on joining the Army next summer. I’ll probably go talk to recruiters by January or February and just trying to make a decision. I’m mainly going into the Army for the experience not so much as a career unless I love my job. 11B and 12B both sound awesome but am worried I’ll regret it from what I hear from videos I’ve watched. I’ve heard of people not getting to do the job they signed up to do very often and get stuck doing shit details. For anyone who has been a 11B or 12B or currently is one do you recommend going that route or is it not really worth it over other MOS’s I could choose. Also interested in a realistic week of what each of these MOS’s do since most videos only show the best of what they do and not a realistic day to day. Appreciate anyone taking the time answering my questions!

(question starts in paragraph 2) Took the ASVAB and went to MEPS back in mid August, scored an 85, DQ for an old asthma diagnosis and antidepressant prescription from 2 years and 8 months ago at the time, quickly did what was asked of me to get waived, received the asthma waiver, because I don’t have asthma, then my recruiter was able to schedule the psych evaluation, backed up until mid January, fine, whatever, been waiting since then.

My question: is my recruiter bullshitting me? He has said since day one I can get airborne even with the waivers, I have not received an airborne physical, when I asked about it the recruiting station (commander? Chief?) said they would put in a special order for just the airborne physical at MEPS. I have no reason to question their promises, although while looking it up everyone I see asking about it is being told you cannot get an option 4 with any waivers, so I figured I would float my specific situation by y’all. the recruiter has said I won’t be able to sign opt. 40 or 18x with waivers, but that I should be fine for an opt. 4, and can volunteer for RASP at airborne. (I know I will be able to volunteer for RASP at airborne if I choose to, my question is just if I will be getting an option 4) the final seed of doubt in my mind was at my first go around at MEPS, when meeting with the guy who could print out a contract (if I didn’t need waivers and was G2G) said I couldn’t get airborne with waivers, when I brought this up to my recruiter after MEPS he said the guy must have been mistaken, or meant I couldn’t get airborne until I get my airborne physical, I have just been getting so much info saying “you CAN get an option 4”, then immediately someone else is telling me “You CANT get an option 4” As much as I would love to just take my recruiters word for everything, I wouldn’t be doing myself any favors by not seeking the opinion of people who don’t “get a number” whether I sign or not. Sorry for the wall of text. Thanks.

Should recruiters let you know when they’re on leave? I’ve been working with my recruiter for a while. We got to the part where he submitted my waiver and it got denied. He told me he will submit it again the same day I went to the office and would hear back by the end of the week. No word so I go back in later on and the boss guy told me he talked to his staff sergeant and that they’ll submit my waiver then. Did they not submit it the last time I went? Texting my guy to let me know when it’s submitted and the results and I got no response. Apparently he’s been on leave for a little over a week. I didn’t know, he just disappeared and they’ve been giving me the run around so I was under the assumption that they gave up on me.

What is AIT like?

I graduated BCT recently and will be reporting to Ft Gregg-Adams as a 91S soon, and was wondering what the AIR experience was like. I asked some of the DS's at Basic, but most of them gave pretty vague answers and said that it varies from base-to-base. Below will be a list of questions that I have. If you have the time, answers to any are appreciated. Thank you ahead of time. 

Will I go through reception again at AIT? If yes, will it be as thorough as BCT was, where they make you dump all your bags and check every item you bought? 

What is the living situation like? Will it be similar to basic where I'm in a bay with x amount of other personnel, have a room to myself, or be with just a few other bunkmates?

Following up living arrangements, am I able to bring my PS5 and monitor? Will I have enough personal time that it would even be worth bringing?

How does going off post work? Since I am not allowed a POV while in training, do I have to uber/lyft anywhere I need to go that isn't within walking distance?

I have a ton of questions, but I can't think of them on the spot right now, so maybe I will make another post later, but for now these are my main curiosities/concerns. Any input is appreciated, thank you in advance for your time.

Hi, when I enlisted into the National Guard, I took parts of a questionnaire that I found out was pre-filled when I did a background check for a TSA job application.

1.) Was it the SF-86 I was filling out before enlistment or was it something they use from it to gather relevant information pertaining to me?

There's a section on it that asks for foreign contacts and after swearing it, I find out that I'm in contact with a foreign national over social media which turned into a full blown relationship not too long after.

I come home from IET not even a day later and we ended things with each other but I have never been contacted by an investigator during my training and apparently obtained my security clearance while in BCT.

2.) Will I just have to contact my unit to let them know that I was in this relationship or will the information on the SF-86 for TSA suffice?

Jobs

Prior service here, looking to go back into my original MOSs but it’s under precision retention so idk how that’s gonna go. 

My grade determination came back and it said I have to choose from 35F, 35G, 35P, 35T, and 88H to keep my grade. 

Anyone know how life is in those MOSs? What’s the day to day job like? What type of units would I be in?Trying to figure out what I should choose as a back up option.

I’m in Basic on HBL. Is there any way I can check my military email? I have a CAC and CAC reader. I also have access to a navy base nearby if I need to use their computer. 

Any help would be appreciated

Attempting to enlist in the Army as 11B, failed my hearing test twice as an H3 🤦‍♂️They didn’t clean my ears so I assume they didn’t see a reason to. From what I know, I don’t have hearing issues but clearly the test shows other wise. I can’t tell you the exact scores because I don’t remember, but I do remember that my lower frequency scores were within normal ranges, then as it progress to mid- high frequencies it got worse and pretty sure my highest frequency was at a 70 score. How likely am I to get a waiver for this? What will the process ensue? Will I be able to keep my MOS with this DQ? to be completely honest, I’m not even sure I did the hearing test correctly because I may have misunderstood the MEPS employee who only explained it once and I was severely deprived of sleep that day, should I mention that as a factor? I should also mention I have 0 problems communicating effectively in every day scenarios, I can hear someone having a private conversation from a closed room away.

I am a 17 yr old girl who is thinking about joining the army because I like the values and the structure, plus I like to get my hands dirty but as I was reading through reddit comments I see a lot of men who advise against women joining. I want to really know how the army culture is, like I know how most guys are and I can handle all the jokes and I can enjoy a few of them but I really wonder if there is anything that I have to worry about or any red flags that I have to pay attention to if I join. My family has told me to make sure to keep my eyes and ears open, but I was wondering if I need to take more caution.  The mos that I want to join is like a 13m

I have a criminal history with no charges and some hand tattoos how likely is it to get multiple waivers approved as 32 yr old male? just began talking with a recruiter today and he said he did not want to give me false hope but he would be talking to his boss and be in touch.

I had my option 40 contract taken because I got to meps and they said that I needed a waiver for astigmatism in my eye. I went back for a second time with a regular infantry contract and then they told me I cant go infantry because my eyes were not corrected to 20/20. I ended up signing a 19d cav scout contract because they were telling me i could still join the regiment as a cav scout but after researching I realized you can't. What would I have to do to join the ranger regiment? Could I just get eye surgery when I get out of bootcamp and switch to infantry? How quickly could I switch my mos? I signed for 3 years.

I’m 17 and my mom is making me join the military. I know technically I don’t have to, but I have to live with her and she’s my legal guardian, and she’s a terrifying person. I have too. She wanted me to join the Air Force but I guess they weren’t getting back to her when she was trying to correspond with them because I ended up talking to an army recruiter. I’m going to meps tommorow and after medical she wants me to refuse to swear. I don’t know about the “permanentness” (for lack of better words) of swearing at meps and if that makes it set that I have to join the army, but she’ll get upset if I swear anyways. Who would I tell and when that im not swearing. I’m trying to avoid awkwardness and kind of do it as smooth as possible, I have no idea what I’m walking into tommorow and Thursday.  
(I also have a bad cold right now, I can work through life and stuff fine, but my nose is inflamed and congested asf, and I heard the meps doctors are strict. Will I probably not swear anyways orrrr?)

I am joining Army Reserve - 27d (not official  yet still have to go through MEPS). Hoping yall could help me out with some questions. 

•recruiter mentioned I may be able to skip some AIT because my civilian job is closely related. I haven’t been able to find out much about this. I’m not sure if I should do that or just go get the actual army training. Anyone have any advice? 
• I want to deploy (hopefully to some place interesting) sooner rather than later. How much of a say do I get as a reserve member about timeline and location? Could there be any chance of coming back from training and leaving within a month or so?

Hi everyone, 

I'm about to join the Army (obviously) and I really need some help picking an MOS. I scored a 95 on my ASVAB and have every possible job I could want which, tbh is a little overwhelming. I'm currently fixed on 25B and 37F as they I have personal interests in both and believe they allow for fantastic opportunities outside of the military. My main goal is to get an MOS I like and has useful skills in the civilian world, gain experience and familiarity with the military, and then submit a packet for SFAS. I don't want to join as an 18X because I personally want to advantage of some of the scholastic benefits I have access to while active duty. I would really love to hear some experience from guys in 25B or 37F but also just guys who are active and like their MOS or retired guys who found great success in the civilian world due to the experience they gained in their MOS. 

For added context I am 26, not kids, never married, and serving in the military has always been a goal of mine and I want to milk my benefits and come out as best I possibly can on the other side. 

Thanks in advance.

Did I do the MEPS hearing test wrong twice?

I failed 2 hearing test twice at MEPS. Does anyone know how exactly it’s performed? If I hear a series of 3 beeps in a row, do I push the button once at the first beep or do I press the button 3 times in a row? I need to know if I failed due to my own negligence or because I genuinely have hearing issues.

Hello everyone,

This one is probably asked a lot but here it goes. So right now I’m 24 pushing 25 and have done  two office jobs and was terrible at both of them. I’ve always wanted to be in the military but am curious about the office work load that officers get. Are you constantly doing paper work as an officer in the army if so should I consider being enlisted since I was pretty bad at being at my office jobs and would succeed better outside working hands on instead of being at a computer.

I’m a prior service Marine switching to army. For MOS’s I was offered either 13B or 19K. I’d like to do the full 20 and make a career out of the military. Which MOS would I have an easier/better career in? I know I’m stupid but I’m interested in both MOS’s. Completely aware most soldiers in 13B or 19K hate their lives. From my research it seems that 13B has the better duty stations and more duty stations to choose from and I’d have a better chance of going to schools like airborne or air assault. For 19K I found being a tanker slightly more interesting and I heard the promotions are really fast. Any advice would be appreciated. I’m being very indecisive.

What are the Female Physical Requirements?

I’m enlisting into the army very soon and I wanted to know what all females have to go through during basic training. My cousin is also in the army however, he is a male in infantry so I know that females don’t necessarily do as much as males. My mos will be a 42A but I would like to know the physical requirements for BCT so therefore I can prep myself such as “rucking”, deadlifts, planks, push-ups, etc. Do/can females do knee-push-ups or full out push-ups? Also how long would I be rucking in duration of miles &amp; estimated amount of weight. I will also be in Fort Jackson, SC if that helps as well. I’m new to all this so I just wanna come as prepared as possible.

Army,"Firstly, sorry but this is going to be a long one. I (22m) am a 91L who joined the army a year ago because I thought I had no better way of getting the experience I needed to work on the equipment I wanted to work on. I went to a tech college and got an associates in Diesel and Heavy Equipment Technology, and I absolutely love working on equipment, but I hate basically every other aspect of the army. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve met some of the greatest people I’ve ever known here, but that alone is not proving enough to make me feel like this is worth it. I reconnected with a girl I was friends with from all the way back in middle school through high school, but lost contact with for the years between graduation, college, and me moving to Texas for the army. I’ve had a crush on her since middle school, apparently she has too, and we chose to get together while talking over the phone back in august. This holiday block leave was the first time I’d seen her since high school, and leaving her has got to be the absolute hardest thing I’ve ever done. For the first time in my life, it feels like I finally have someone that loves me as I am, not like how my parents do, but by their own choice.  I’m sitting in my barracks room right now writing this, feeling like absolute dogshit and depressed as all hell because I don’t rightly know when I’m going to see her again apart from the rough idea of next holiday block leave. I hate not being near her, I hate being so far away from her and everyone else I know (I’m from NC) and I don’t rightly know what to do at this point because if I could get out then I absolutely would. But between the bonus the army gave me for the contract, my car payment, and the uncertainty of getting a job in the field I want without being scrutinized for leaving the army early, I don’t know what to do. Part of me just wants to bury myself in working so I stop thinking about it but I don’t want to do that because I hated how it made me feel prior to getting back in touch with my girlfriend. I hate pretending I’m something I’m not with saying everything will be okay and I’ll just push through the army. I hate making myself be something I’m not just so I don’t let down the people around me because I can’t fucking run worth shit so the fucking acft is always a struggle for me. I hate all of this and I just want to go home and forget I ever thought I could make it in the army.

Army,"So to start off with some background, I’m a 15W that is waiting to start class so that I can become MOS-Q (Qualified) and head to my first duty station. When I was researching Aviation jobs that related to operating drones, I did not find much info on the different MOSs and their job descriptions. So I thought I’d share some with others now that I know. 

The drone you will be operating is called the RQ-7 Shadow. From my understanding, our classroom cirriculum mainly includes memorizing different emergency procedures, then just getting familiar with the operation platform and how to read the information on the screen.


In regards to the barracks life, everyone wakes up for PT at 0400, then we march to the DFAC around 0600. From there, if you are a hold (not in class) you walk back to the barracks in battle buddy pairs and have around 3 hours to be productive (nap) or exercise at the nearby gym. Our Company is made up of around 150 students all of which are 15W, 15E, 15C or 15M.


We have 3 formations during the weekday. All of which are for attendance purposes and to make sure no one is dead in a ditch somewhere. As for the busywork, depending on how the company “behaves” it’s between, picking weeds, cleaning vacant rooms on the empty floors of the barracks, or random field training (rarely) like LandNav or voluntary Ruck Marches which you can earn lots of promotion points for participating in.


Weekend/Holiday privileges are based on your phase status. Everyone (besides MOS-Ts) begins as Phase IV and is able to apply for phase up testing after 3 weeks upon arrival. As Phase V you are able to go 30 miles off post, can skip certain accountability formations and as a result have about 9 uninterrupted hours of the day to yourself 0900-1800. As Phase V+ (Final phase) You are able to store and consume food in your room as well as go 100 miles off post on weekends. During the weekday you have the option to skip chow formations and not march down to the DFAC with the rest of the company. Battle buddies are required when going anywhere outside the company area.

Our ETS date is on July 13th, by then he'll have 60 days of leave which hell take as ETS leave. Now i wanted to know if its possible for him to get out of germany during his leave so we can go back stateside or if he has to stay here till his ETS date. (Im german and married to him, im sorry if my grammar isnt the best lol) Also wed like to know if hes requried to fly home via military flight or if hes able to fly lufthansa with me (we have two cats and a dog which we need to take on the flight back stateside, im not command sponsored so i have to pay everything on my own and fly with lufthansa.) well go back to florida and lufthansa wont fly animals after july as its to warm, now im concerned that he cant fly with me and we arent able to fly together in may or june. I honestly dont wanna fly without him and i wanna have all my animals there at once which means because of the airline restrictions that only two animals are allowed per person. 

im sorry if i wrote absolute nonsense lo but so far noone is able to give us some kind of answer. We are gonna ship his car back hopefully as soon as we get the orders. now i wanna know if someone did leave before ETS date and what have you done to be able to do that? how does it work to ship household goods and is he able to fly with a ""normal airline""? And maybe someone had experience flying with lufthansa maybe even as dependet and if youre able to take more luggage with you and maaaybe even how a flight works with animals.

And if I do get out, what are the prospects for me? I did some limited CNA work before getting in but not formal degree.

Army,"Ok, so bear with me here. 

I’m conflicted because I have a couple of options that I’m weighing out but I ultimately want to go Civil Affairs. I have the option to do SMP Cadet (something like ROTC) and essentially sign with an MOS (68W), finish up my school after about 3yrs but with this route, it requires that I commission as an officer upon graduation (complete either 8 years reserve upon graduation or compete for Active Duty [4yrs]), and as far as going CA I’m aware that I’d be looking at around another 3-4 more years before I’d even be able to put in a packet for a CA Officer. 

OR

I can directly enlist as a 38B in the Reserves and wait some time (say 2-3 years) and then try to go Active Duty and attend CAAS. During this time in the reserves I’d also like to finish my school in person (if possible), I’m guessing this way I won’t have to go the Officer route.

Also, how long would it take me to reach the required rank of SPC in the reserves component?

OR

I’ve thought about the prospect of enlisting Active Duty as a 35P (which I’m aware I’d have to go 35W), gaining valuable language skills and then putting a packet in for Civil Affairs when I reach the required rank (not sure on the timeframe). 

Any guidance or suggestions are appreciated. Which of these makes more sense?

Well it made me relic on my first duty station, showing up to 2CR as an 18 year old 11b in December 2011. 

The details are all important because I had A. No experience in the world, and now I’m suddenly in Europe with an old Samsung phone that slid up for a keyboard and a laptop with a US outlet. The phone was basically dead but before it died never fixed the time and I didn’t have anyone to ask the time. I show up to the unit, get yelled at for about an hour and get picked up by some SSG who tells me I’ll be in the scout platoon, however, I hadn’t tried out for it so it fuckin sucks to be me. Also - in December, if you didn’t know gets dark AF early in the afternoon in Germany. Didn’t know that either.

The SSG takes me to the PX to get some blankets and whatnot, I think we discussed timezone differences but again my phone was done for and nobody including him told me about the outlet situation and I hadn’t been to the barracks yet. We get to the barracks and everyone has a roommate who sleeps in the same room with them, except for me. There is nobody there to give me a heads up on anything.

Next morning I wake up to absolute beatings on my door by a ton of specialists who had just got back from Afghanistan FREAKING OUT at me because it was 0600 and I hadn’t shown up yet. Once I’m fandangled into uniform I ask the CQ if they ever knocked on my door and these dudes just chuckle and go back to doing nothing. I show up to my platoon area where my acting PSG (who I don’t know and is in PTs) is going OFF on me about how every infantryman should have an internal clock and know what time it is at all portions of the day.

Army,"If you haven’t heard, you no longer go to “My Absences” in IPPS-A to request leave. You go to “PAID” (Pay-Absences-Incent-Ded) to do that now. In some ways, the update actually seems better than the old system. But there’s a big flaw: you can no longer edit or delete any requests after you’ve submitted them. Here’s why that really sucks. 

My child was born last Thursday, so now I’ve gotta go in and request paternity leave so I can be home to help the wife out and be with my family. I unfortunately wasn’t able to get on IPPS-A on my phone or my computer on the hospital wifi (and there was no phone carrier service) and my wife and child weren’t discharged until Saturday. So we get home, I make a request, and go on with my day. Later on, I realize that I chose “birth of child” and not “non-birth parent” when requesting, which means I have to go in and change that. This is when I discovered that you can’t edit or delete requests anymore. Only the commander (hopefully) can. So I make a second request and explain the situation in the comments section of my new request. No big deal. 

Except now I realize that I’ve been requesting my leave to start on 03Jan, right after the 4-day. Uh-oh, I can’t do that, since the commander isn’t going to even see that request until 03Jan when we all return to work. I still have to report for duty that day since leave requested is not the same as leave approved. Realizing this, I go in to “edit” my request yet again, now for the third time. In comes our second major flaw in PAID. Since all three of my paternity leave requests would now exceed 84 days combined (84 is the max paternity leave dates allowed per birth/adoption/foster), my third request is not valid for submission. Now I get to email my commander explaining the whole situation and I feel like a tool for making all these mistakes back to back, but that’s what happens when your newborn destroys your sleep schedule. 

I don’t know if I’ll ever see the day when the military doesn’t give a contract to the lowest bidder, but it would be nice if we had a centralized system that wasn’t constantly full of coding errors.

So I already made a post in another Reddit thread, but I’ve been having some issues like projectile vomiting, diarrhea, and discovered a hammerhoids lump. 

I discovered the lump 3 weeks ago and recruiter said it’s not big deal. But I’ve noticed it’s gotten bigger and I’ve been pooping puss &amp; blood.

I’m in extreme pain - recruiter says I should suck it up and deal with it in reception, but will they tho? I can’t eat anything without vomiting or having bad diarrhea.

Army,"I'm at my first assignment where we have a heavy GS Employee presence within our organizations. Looking for advice on dealing with a shitty GS employee that's causing my team and supervisors headaches.

We had a really good GS Staff primary retire. His replacement, is not good. The guy is suave, charismatic, confident, and appears technically confident. Meanwhile, this hiree has no work ethic and continues to gets my team, who serves in the higher HQs, in trouble constantly. We've been tasked multiple times for either myself or my team to go down to his location to ""Catch him up on work"" for a recorded period of 54 calendar days and counting. 

Analyzing our help desk tickets for example, in the month of November, we had 271 help desk tickets come into our shop. 176 of those tickets came from his organization, or 65% for that months tickets. Out of those 176 tickets, 148 tickets or 84% of those tickets, were account activation and cell phone tickets. Out of my other organizations? They had requested for support for issues they couldn't do at their level, but overall, zero tickets for account activations and cell phone activations were sent by those six other organizations. The data for the other months more/less looks the same.

During one of our forced visits by my chain-of-command, our NCO discovered the new hire was committing time card fraud (unauthorized vacation), was late to work every day, and leaves early daily. I informed the person's leadership, who told to me to ""mind my own business"". HR was worthless too. They threw up their hands, told me that if the COC doesn't want to do anything about it, then they can't touch it. My leadership got scared, told me that time card fraud is a big deal, and left it alone. I tried IG and IG directed me back to HR, whose not doing anything about it.

The guy's actions are starting to impact my team's morale. We keep having to provide soldiers to ""catch him up"". My leadership is apathetic and doesn't see anything wrong with helping the guy out. Just recently, he got my XO in trouble at a meeting for failing to do a high visibility task. Everyone who has to work with this guy continues to complain, but it falls on deaf ears. The response continues to be, ""Do the job for the guy"". We are now at the point now where I can't go half a day without some sort of problem happening at his level that only my team can solve or do.

For context sake, it is not a replacement for TAP, VA, SkillBridge, or any other organization that helps you get skills/employment after you are out. It is not meant to be focused on any one service branch (although it might be Army heavy at the moment because that’s where I’m from). It is to address what the heck is going to happen to you as you get closer to getting out (regardless of reason, such as Medboard vs. retirement vs. not renewing your contract).

I’m a 36 year old army wife and I have been married to my husband (33), for 2 years. In the last two years he’s been abusing steroids and me. When he’s not roid raging he’s a great guy. However now, he’s taking heavy Russian steroids and injecting a great amount every single day for weeks with no breaks.

I truly want him to get help and get off steroids since I can leave him but my daughter will still have to see him. He’s been on them 17 years straight no breaks other than for basic training. 

He always had a bad temper but who he’s become now with this insane dose he’s taking is absolutely terrifying. If I leave him while he’s still on them I’m scared he’ll come kill me. 

If I tell his command would he get kicked out or would they get him the help? 

I don’t want him kicked out because he’s the father of my child and he needs the job as he wasn’t successful doing anything else. 


But if I leave him before he gets help I’m scared he will come kill me or hurt me. I currently have so many random bruises from his freak outs. 

He said he wouldn’t get off steroids for any reason no matter what.

Army,"Lately, I have seen so many ""I want out"" or ""this shit sucks"" type posts and I just want to offer a bit of perspective.  

I have been in the Army for 24 years and I plan on retiring just shy of 26.  I have been AD enlisted, NG enlisted, and currently, I am an AD officer.  I've deployed three times to Afghanistan and I've PCS'd nine times, for context.  

My first duty station was Ft. Hood, pre-9/11.  This was well before smartphones and wifi became ubiquitous.  I thought my unit was pretty good, I made a lot of friends and had a lot of fun - even when it sucked.  Camaraderie was pretty high.  

From Hood, I went to Germany.  Germany was an absolute blast and I had an amazing three years there.  I absolutely hated my unit in Germany and my leadership.  I dreaded every day and only looked forward to the weekend.  I legit had a thought one day that if I could only break my arm, I'd not have to go to work today.  That's how much I hated going.  But I loved Germany, so it balanced in a way.  As much as it sucked at times, I never contemplated failing PT, HT/WT, or something else more drastic to simply get out.  I know a lot of you may feel like you need to consider these, but I implore you not to cut off your nose to spite your face - as the adage goes.  I joined for a shot at a better life, consider why you joined before you get drastic and while it may not register now - you may look back in 10 years and wish you stayed the course.  

I ETS'd from Germany and was heading to college to do ROTC.  I really disliked my unit and most of the leadership, but I also realized that whole grass is greener adage.  Overall, the Army was good to me.  I had one great unit and one bad unit, so I was 50/50.  Plus, college was always a goal of mine since I grew up poor and the Army was the only way I was going to get a college education.  That, and I was ETSing and heading to college at the time my HS friends were just graduating college, had debt, and didn't make much money.  I thought real hard about just doing school and remaining a civilian, but the Army itself, the pension, and a few other factors tipped me towards the Army as a career.   

In the end, going back to the Army as an O was a no-brainer - for me.  But for you, again, consider why you joined.   A great NCO once told me to never base your feelings about the Army on one duty station alone.  I don't know if this is still a thing - but how I got to Germany from Hood was by submitting a 4187 for re-assignment.  You used to be able to do this once you hit 12 months on station.  I'm not saying this will work for you, but it may be something to look into if you're not currently happy in your current unit.  

The Army has changed a bit in 24 years.  Society has changed a bit too.  The Army has some pervasive issues to work through as well.  But please, I implore you, do not resort to drastic measures simply to get out.  You truly never do know what unintended consequences those actions may have.  Take care of your health, both mental and physical, and even if the Army isn't fully for you - use this time to plan (and save money) for what you want your life to look like post-Army.

Army,"Long story short, upon coming home for HBL, I found out my wife was dealing coke. We are separated atm, and she resides in the mainland currently. As we are hanging out in my hotel room after she picked me up from the airport, she received at least two calls from people who wanted her to drop off drugs. Due to the fact that I had no knowledge of her doing/selling drugs prior to seeing her, I felt uncomfortable and asked her to leave. She stood in my doorway for a few minutes as we argued and I continuously asked her to leave, but eventually I walked out to the elevator, at which point she followed me. Once she took the elevator down with me, I took it back up, which she continued to follow me, but she stayed in the elevator while I went to my room. At that point, she no longer followed me and she spammed my phone the remainder of the night and I ignored all of her attempted calls and messages. I know this made her extremely furious.

Army,"I'm facing a unique challenge regarding my citizenship status that's hindering my ability to obtain a security clearance. I was born in South Africa, and my family immigrated to the US when I was young. My father obtained US citizenship while I was under his custody, making me a derived citizen. The catch is, I lack paperwork aside from an outdated passport confirming my US citizenship.

I've worked through my chain of command up to the Brigade level with limited success. The Army recognizes me as a US citizen but also insists I still hold South African citizenship. To resolve this, I believe I need paperwork renouncing my South African citizenship and possibly a certificate affirming my US citizenship. However, the process is unclear, and every visit to my S2 results in changing requirements.

My biggest hurdle is dealing with the South African government. Despite numerous attempts over 8 months, I've received minimal to no assistance. After an in-person visit to the consulate in NY, I acquired the renouncement paperwork, but it requires approval from South Africa, a process that could take up to six months.

It's been a month and a half with no updates, and my inquiries remain unanswered. I lack faith in the South African government and fear I might never see the required paperwork. Additionally, I've received conflicting information on whether the renouncement alone is sufficient or if I need additional documents like an N600.

While I understand a security clearance isn't mandatory for Army service, it's preventing me from attending SERE school and reclassing to EOD. I've exhausted my resources seeking guidance and haven't received clear answers.

If any of you have faced a similar situation or have advice on navigating this complex process, I would greatly appreciate your insights. Thanks for the help.

Army,"I ETS in October of 2024. I plan on taking a CSP from April until late September early October and allowing myself 10 days to clear post. I am also taking 56 days of leave before my CSP. What can I do before I take leave/CSP to make things easier when I come back to the area 10 days before my ETS? 

Does anyone have a checklist or possibly personal experience with getting out of the Army similar to how I am? I was told I could do my capstone before my CSP but it wasn’t confirmed. I was also told that you could clear CIF before your CSP but you need ETS orders but you can’t get those until you’re 90-180 days out.  Also, I plan on doing a BDD claim but by that window I’ll be in the middle of my CSP in a completely different state. 

Any advice would help.

Army,"I’m calling all lifers and mainly people who’ve done 10+ years to give me their opinion. 





So I’m currently a PFC and a mechanic posting this on a burner account so 1SG doesn’t know. But anyway here’s my plan: Finish out current 4 year contract and reenlist for another 3-4 years active changing MOS with the hope of getting an overseas duty station and a bonus. After that reenlist into guard or reserve and complete the rest of my service in that and retire at 20 years. I may be wrong on how that works so please correct me.





So far I’ve been in the regular for almost a year and I do like it. I feel like most of my gripes and dislikes are because of the MOS I’m in. I don’t like being a mechanic. Crawling under humvees, loud trucks, being covered in grease everyday. Especially when we don’t have any work and they put us on a random task or do someone else job.




My plan is to 100% switch MOSs into the most POGiest MOS that doesn’t go to the field often, easy on the body and I’m not ashamed to admit it. I want to do my job and just mine no one else’s. Pretty much admin work I would assume fits that criteria. I see so many young soldiers my age just not give af about their health or what they do to their body. Imagine being made fun of for attempting to get 8 hours of sleep. It’s absolutely pathetic. Being a mechanic and in the Army is especially hard on your body And I don’t want to be broken at 30. 







I don’t want to do all the high speed schools or other branches like being a drill sergeant. I see a lot of younger soldiers who give higher ranked shit and their fellow younger soliders shit because they don’t have a CAB or don’t wear any patches. I do agree that those who go the extra mile should be rewarded but is it right to have the “if you ain’t us you ain’t shit” mentality towards others for it?





Is I know me saying all of this has you thinking why didn’t I just join the Airforce well I was but stuff happened and I’m in the Army. 





I truly do like being a solider and wearing our uniform but I feel like I could be way more of service in a different job than this.

I’m a lot older now, I haven’t really done much since I’ve been out. Misc. jobs from software analyst, to managing Amazon, and various IT positions. 

When it comes to IT certs I only have A+ (expired a few years back but the knowledge is never lost). 

They have a 25B IT specialist mos available with a 10k sign on. Last year there was no sign on bonus for it. 

I’ve gone through most postings through online/reddit about this mos. I know once AIT is done it’s all unit dependent on what I’ll actually be doing. But with only having an A+ is the AIT difficult? I’ve taken a few other classes ranging from NET+ and Sec+, also windows 10 server from this shitty trade school in AZ. No certifications for those though.  I’m not necessarily the smartest person, but I feel I am average at learning things related to IT. 

Then there’s 35F, intelligence analyst. 7.5k sign on bonus. I get I won’t be doing analyst work, probably details and volunteer shit. But it sounds easy and I could probably study more IT certs while in this mos. Also, I’ve read promotion points are easier with 35F compared to 25B. 

I want to be set up by the time I ETS again if I don’t retire from the army. I’m trying to be smart about it this time. I was just a kid back then. After two tours I just wanted to get out with no plan. That was dumb of me.

Army,"**BLUF: the Army places too much emphasis on ACFT scores and needs to start caring more about actual professional development when it comes to promotions, OMLs, etc.**

When the ACFT was first announced, it made sense as a concept. The APFT had a lot of issues: it caused injuries (situps are bad), it wasn't representative of holistic fitness, and it was super easy to game. Creating a new fitness assessment that was based more closely on what soldiers would have to do during combat made a lot of sense. We all know that didn't go as well as it could have. Let's quickly go through some highlights from the ACFT's struggles:

* It started off as a sex and age neutral test, only having different categories based on MOS. This made a ton of sense.

* An overwhelming majority of women failed the leg tuck, so it was replaced with an option to do a plank. Then, the plank replaced the leg tuck altogether.

* The test was revised to have age and gender categories.

* Congress told the Army not to do that, we didn't listen, and the fate of the test was in limbo once again.

* The new NDAA lets us keep sex-based assessment, but requires stricter standards for combat MOSs.

Personally, I think the ACFT's original method of grading made more sense than anything else we've ever done. Grading by sex and/or age seems silly to me when the battlefield doesn't care about those things. Indirect fire doesn't bracket you more slowly if you're old; your 250 pound (in kit) battle buddy who got shot doesn't weigh less if you're a woman. Soldiers should all be judged by their ability (or lack thereof) to meet **the standard**, whatever we determine that is.

I was having a conversation with a female soldier recently about all of this, and she mentioned that she was in favor of the sex-based grading for the ACFT because doing otherwise was unfair to females when it came to things like promotion points, OMLs for schools, and anything else where your score matters are more than just a method of assessing fitness. She's not wrong, but she's complaining about a symptom when she thinks she's talking about a root issue.

The root issue is that **the Army places FAR too much weight on fitness assessments** for things like promotions, who gets to go to what school, or selections for support personnel to SOF units. The best example of this is how promotion points are calculated. a maxed PT test is nearly worth more than the most you can achieve by maxing out PME and correspondence courses *combined*. how does that make sense? Is it just laziness, because a PT test is easier to grade than doing the work and combing through the various military professional development and MOS-specific courses and deciding what they should be worth? Or is the old joke about how soldiers are meatheads at heart little more true than we want it to be?

Army,"Need some S1 help here, I've ran into an issue.
Gonna try to keep this as vague as possible

TLDR
Failed acft during 1st contract in the Reserves, deployed, got out, came back in and am now running into issues with a temp promotion as well as a possible work around.

Here's a little back story of everything first.
First contract was in the Reserves. Due to my original unit disbanding, I was sent to an entirely different unit and had to go back to AIT to receive an additional MOS as ASI. 
Manage to locate a unit in the Midwest and transferred over there to do my original MOS.
Before one drill date I had broken up with a long time ex, and decided to just drive down to drill with my dog since I wasn't taking care of myself. At the end of drill, was told to do a walk on BLC course, was not prepared physically or mentally.
Took and failed the ACFT, but probably would have been kicked out anyways due to not having any of the required packing list other than a couple uniforms, let alone I was sleeping with my dog in my truck.

Fast forward a bit, volunteered for a deployment. Enjoyed the beginning of it, but due to things happening at the end of it I went to the SRU. During my time at the SRU, somehow I was scheduled for a BLC slot. Even had I known, I wouldn't have been able to go to that BLC slot due to receiving care. Decided to get out of the Army for awhile directly afterwards because of reasons, left with an HD. 

Fast forward a bit more, missed the Army and decided to go active this time. Wanted more certifications that the Army would provide and I just missed it. 

Coming into the Army was a mess, recruiter messed up my paperwork and I was hit with a Fraudulent Enlistment, had my SC revoked for a little bit and got it back. Was a pain but got through all of that and was happy to get to my next duty station to do my job. 
Found out my TIS and BASD wasnt correct and met with retention to fix that, she submitted the documents to IPERMs and I in return gave them to my S1. When I finally looked at my ippsa profile, everything was wrong. TIS, TIG, BASD, previous units(appereantly Ive got 20 or so different listing in the same UIC), deployments

This marked the beginning of my issues with S1. Had so many issues with me submitting my college, awards, deployments and everything else. I would submit them, make appointments and nothing would get done and only managed to get my awards uploaded because I stayed there until I watched them do it because I wanted to pick up.

Once that was done, my points were looking good minus my college. I killed the P Board, had a BLC date set and a week before broke my toe because of a soldier smacking a 88m tow bar we were carrying causing us to all to drop it.
For some reason though, I was not populating on the OML even though I had secured the BLC slot.

By the time my toe healed, I was deployed. Tried to get promoted because I had made points twice since getting my P status at that point however my name never populated on the list.

Since then, I've submitted 3 Pars, each one with more and more information detailing reasons and supporting documents.
This last one stated that it was because I have a history of failed BLC slots, in particular the one I had in the Reserves in my first contract before my break in service. 
I've checked ATTRS, and the 2 slots I had after that first one were med releases. However, after thoroughly checking my Iperms I could not locate the 1059 for the Reserves BLC slot. After calling the schoolhouse and speaking to them, they informed me it was up to the unit at the time to upload it which they never did and that they didn't have the record of it in their paper system.

Ive heard so much about what could be wrong, and what I should do and how, that I finally said enough and was hoping someone who knows their S1 stuff can help me out.

Things I've heard and been told so far:

•I'm barred from Enlistment due to the failed BLC slot 
-If that were the case i wouldn't have been able     to come back in, I even had retention check it out and they verified that I have no flag and I'm not barred
•TIS isn't accurate in IPPSA so that's the reason I'm not populating on the OML and not getting promoted
•Need the CGs permission to go to BLC and have a copy of the 1059 in question (which was never uploaded)
•Reserves stuff doesn't fully transfer over so I should be good
•No record of the 1059 for the failed BLC so just call HRC and ask them to remove it
-This just feels sketchy
•I just have to wait till I'm able to get another walk on slot
-I hope that's not the case, because I'm losing motivation fast because everything is all messed up and I feel that I'm only now being semi helped because of reasons.


There's so much more also going on. I was supposed to transfer to another unit that has a much better S1 and has walk on capabilities for BLC, but now I can't because the receiving CSM doesn't want to do a swap for swap, so now I'm awaiting a open door meeting with my current CSM to see if they're willing to give me away so I can finally get my career progression moving forward.

Army,"Hey everyone,

I'm a sergeant and I've got a bit of a situation with one of my soldiers that I could use some advice on. This troop has been under a flag for two years now, but there's been no punishment handed down or even a formal reading. It's a bit of an odd situation, and I'm not sure how to proceed.

From my perspective, it doesn't seem fair to the soldier to be left hanging like this. It's impacting their morale and potentially their career progression. I believe in maintaining discipline, but this just doesn't sit right with me.

Additionally, it's worth mentioning that this soldier has proactively sought help from behavioral health for other personal issues. They're actively engaged in counseling and are making a genuine effort to rehabilitate and improve themselves. This commitment to self-improvement and mental health is commendable and, in my opinion, should be factored into how we handle their flag status. It shows a level of responsibility and self-awareness that I believe is a positive sign. 

I'm considering pushing this up the chain of command to get it resolved, either by removing the flag (if they've been squared away since it was placed) or by moving forward with whatever actions are deemed necessary if there are still unresolved issues.

Has anyone dealt with something like this before? How did you handle it? Any advice on how to approach this with the higher-ups?

Army,"Please bear with me so I can explain my situation- 
Advice and criticism is welcomed… 

First question. what is my MSO? Is it my original MSO (05/2024), my “reduced” MSO (05/2023, already passed) or did I fuck myself and give myself a new MSO out in 2026?

Second question, is it hard to go TPU to IRR these days? Nothing on the USARC share point mentions it not being a possible option, there’s an in depth walk through about how to do the process in iPPSA. Is anything about my situation going to cause problems with going IRR until I hit my MSO, whether it’s in 2024 or 2026?

Third question, does anyone have good things to say about IMA? I have a hard time believing there is a real job opening that I’m qualified for where I can just “show up when I feel like it”. That sounds like the “no colonel left behind fantasyland” for senior officers waiting to retire.

Situation:

Commissioned in 2016- 8 year MSO w/ 5 active years. No ragrets.

Ended up doing almost 7yr active duty, then I UQR’d. ETS date from AD of 3/31/2023

During my transition I had serious financial, employment, and health insurance (infant at home, sick wife) concerns.

Decided to give TPU life / USAR a try, as I have some friends that went that route and enjoy it. I was told at the time, and still am under the impression was a no-obligation-added move.

My ROCC sets me up with a transfer memo to where I don’t have any additional time added to MSO- I declined to take a bonus, but I did take the 36 month MOB deferment, and I take the 1 year MSO reduction, and I take the TAMP180 benefit. 

At the time of my ETS, my actual MSO end date was 05/2024. 
The 1 year MSO reduction would put me at 05/2023 (yes, a date in the past…)
So I go about my business the last 10 months or so, do what I need to do and show up to BA and be a team player. 

Now, however, my circumstances have changed and I need to get out. I have a 1 year old, I landed my dream civilian job, I have a heavy workload of traveling &amp; OT pay coming up over the next year. Not to mention I ended up with a higher-than-expected VA rating from active duty injuries. 

Because of civilian career obligations, I will be unable to do AT, and unable to drill most of this year due to work and calendar conflicts. No, I’m not willing to miss out on my civilian pay and benefits for USAR unless I have literally no option. 

From a cost-benefit standpoint, USAR is barely worth it: Factoring my VA debt from drill days, I make considerably less money in USAR on a per hourly basis. thus, if I’m going to miss 1/4 to 1/2 of my weekends to travel for my higher paying civilian job, it’s not worth it to give up another weekend of family time for the benefit we get from drill pay + tricare (I can get the best high deductible family plan from my employer for $200/mo more). 

Not to mention the considerable unpaid time sink of being a staff officer - and the PAIN IN THE ASS of dealing with owing a VA debt, and constantly having to stay on top of two careers. I am also feeling discouraged from the nonstop pay and personnel issues I’ve experienced, and seen other soldiers experience in my reserve unit. My heart isn’t in it anymore since I realized that the grass is actually a lot greener on the other side.

I see 3 options: IMA, IRR, or ETS. 

When I bring up this situation to my unit, they tell me OH HO HO you actually owe us 3 years, glhf. But nobody can produce a document that I signed that says I have another 3 year MSO… They also say that I won’t get accepted to IRR due to undermanning issues. 

So I guess according to them I can either go IMA, remote drill from my other job, or just take it on the chin?

For a while now, I’ve felt like doing something different. My MOS is 6116, Tiltrotor Mechanic for the MV-22 Osprey. I lost one of my close friends in a recent crash during a training exercise that happened on the 27th of August, 2023. I am an E4. I felt like pursuing my own dream which I expressed dearly to my friend before he passed. 

     I want to become a tanker. My dream before joining the USMC was to be a tanker. But, as most of us know, the Marine Corps decided it wanted to change, There are no more tanks, and LAVs are not my forte. So finally, what I am asking is how hard would it be for me to transfer to the Army and that MOS when it is time to re-enlist? I would like input from people who have experienced this, or people who know what I can do to achieve this goal. I am a bit skeptical as I would be an NCO with no prior experience in this MOS; Given the fact that the Marine Corps transfers your rank when you change the branch in which you serve.

I’ll try to make this post as clear as possible. 
I went to an inpatient facility for drugs (opioid dependency disorder).. 

I am 20 and went once when I was 19 and once more I went back at 20. I had a problem with opioids and other substances. I detoxed and haven’t used since. 

While there the doctor prescribed me medication and said I was manic depressive and they put me on meds. I took them for about 2 weeks and hated the way they made me feel. I haven’t used drugs for over 9 months now and believe that part of my life is over. 

I know they use a new system called GENESIS. So lying doesn’t work anymore (from what I’ve read on other Reddit posts) I am wondering if I’m wasting both the recruiters and my time. 

I already signed all the paperwork and said I have NO medical history because that’s what I was told to do by older service members. The paperwork is already being processed and I should hear back in 2-3 days. Not going to bother asking for a waiver because the marines already submitted my paperwork to MEPS.

Army,"I hate it here. And by here I mean my MOS, 56M, Religious Affairs Specialist (Chap Ass for you older folks.) “ Oh but it’s such a cake job” or “it’s so easy.” You’re right! It’s easy. 

The most incompetent NCOs I’ve ever met are in the Chaplain Corp. Why am I working at BN lvl writing SOPs for the UMTs in the BDE? Division doesn’t even contact my BDE NCO. They just call me. This isn’t my first unit and this has happened several times because “SSG Incompetent isn’t very reliable and we see that the Lower Enlisted Mikes don’t respect them.” Then move them out of that slot and put me there tf. These same SSGs sit at E-6 and just fester. They don’t try to promote or make themselves competitive because it’s so easy to have a cake job and sit on their asses until they retire. I, for the life of me, cannot understand how somebody could just sit and be so comfortable not progressing. This shit is so mind boggling. Every meeting we have to go to it’s always “if you find a soldier that wants to be a 56M make sure they are a high achiever, competitive, and have good character!” Mean while we’re over here retaining Chap Asses that pop hot, never show up on time (if they show up,) and have absolutely 0 discipline. Not only that but they’re just fucking weird. Was talking to one of my MGs today and he was telling me how weird every chap ass he’s ever met is (he’s at my house hanging out pretty often so obviously I’m not too weird.) I was at ALC and we had to talk to the personnel management NCO for our branch and it’s always the same “recruit good soldiers” speech. I asked him why if we’re just going to retain all the shitty ones. I didn’t get an answer but I did get a counseling for saying “shitty” and lost my graduation honors (still had 3rd highest gpa.) 

I’ve never had a BDE 56M that was worth a damn. It’s me and 1 other SGT working at the bn level and they’ve never been in FORSCOM. They didn’t know how to set up their kit or even what a kit was referring to when I went over to introduce myself. Deadass looked down at their chevrons and told me they (the chevrons)  didn’t mean anything because they (the NCO) had no idea what they were doing. We have 3 PFCs and 2 SPCs in the rest of the BNs and so I try to do training that is actually practical and useful that also doesn’t involve just sitting and watching a power point because I know our SSG at BDE is 0% useful and doesn’t train or try to develop these younger 56Ms. I’ve given up on making SSG. My window opens at the end of the month and my retention is already pulling a list of MOSs to reclass to. 

Sorry for my long rant. I just left my BDE 56Ms office since they can’t answer a phone or respond to email.

Cause with 4 of these per platoon, that’s 4 guns that can be set up in a manner that with the exception of maintenance they can be going at 100% security at all times. Per platoon that employs these 1 could be a tech to provide on the field maintenance and then they could use the forward observer that is used for artillery teams along with drones to get a good picture of what’s going on. 

They could also draw fire in order to expose the muzzle flashes so that infantrymen may be able to get a better picture.

Joined the marine corps at 27(now 31) when at the moment of truth I disclosed  2 “seizures” that I had 2 years prior and never went to the doctors because of lack of medical coverage. I never made it past receiving and eventually got sent home. I had what my doctor called a syncope episode in late 2022 and one in early 2023 and he said it was due to being sunburnt, dehydrated, and drinking alcohol while on vacation. l wasn’t eating healthy then because I wasn’t doing well mentally and coping with unhealthy food and a good amount of alcohol. I have now since stopped and started being healthy again and working out and have been fine. I’ve had an EEG done and results came back normal so nothing neurological. 

I was told when going to medical at parris island that the marine corps is 5 years seizure free without medication can stay or join. 

My question is will the 2 syncope episodes I had and got checked out for disqualifying? Or will I be able to get a waiver. I would like to join a branch before I turn 35 to get that itch to serve taken care of.

# I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus…While Daddy Was Deployed

&gt;Ho, Ho, Ho!  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ironic Major**  
**December 22, 2023**  
&gt;  
&gt;*The following story was submitted by a precocious nine-year-old living in a military community outside Fort Liberty, N.C.*  
&gt;  
&gt;SPRING LAKE, N.C. — Look. I know I’m a kid, but I’m not naive. I know the “big secret”: Santa Claus isn’t real. Just like the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, and those ‘great business opportunities’ Uncle Jody is always trying to sell us.    
&gt;  
&gt;But then again, I know what I saw last night. I was conducting a recon of a suspected cache of presents when I heard voices in the living room. I immediately went into stealth mode and made a silent approach. As I crept up to the edge of the stairs and peered into the living room, [I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.itGitThoIIZtsAMmNDPJ1sCzzR-_cgt02TMXADFAP3w).

&gt;Like I said, I’m no dummy. I know it was really my dad in a Santa suit.

Please don't come at me for this. Two people with differing opinions and neither of us are in the service. 

Someone served in the marine reserves for around 5 years, give or take. He never went to combat or anything like that, and has no psychological issues from his time in the service. He does from his childhood.

 He was married to a woman and was arrested for hitting her, and somehow honorably discharged. Now several years later he's in jail again for brutally beating his gf woman while under the influence. 

In your opinion, are these the kind of situations that veteran housing is intended for? When he gets out, he will be getting a funded new 1br home to live in.

USMC,"How’s everyone doing?

The longer I’m out, the older I get, the more the war seems like some distant dream that never happened. Some memories are like they happened yesterday.

I find myself laying in bed at night unable to sleep wondering how the hell I got here. I think I struggle having an identity because going to combat was all I ever wanted to do growing up.

Now I’m 31 and feel like life is so meaningless. I have a wife and a dog, I have a great career, I’m in great shape and look young for my age. I really have no complaints other than everything in life feels so fake, like a giant charade.

Part of me feels like I left my soul in Afghanistan, now I’m a grown man going through the motions of life because I’m ‘supposed’ too. Its hard for me to find ‘purpose’ in anything I do. The only pain I feel is the memories of two dead friends killed in action from my platoon and the thought of my dog dying.

What really throws me off is thinking of how they were 19 &amp; 21 when they were killed, I was 19. We were so young, kids. Its hard to rationalize to myself I survived and my life will keep moving on while theirs was cut so short.

One of the hardest pills for me to swallow is how nobody really cares. I put the USMC and being a combat grunt on such a pedestal growing up. When I was finally in, I felt so much pride. I loved coming home on leave and seeing how proud of me my family was. Now, nobody even asks me about the war, even my family. As time moved on, so did they. I’m safe now and they don’t have to worry about losing a brother or son. I don’t ever talk about the Marines or the military to anyone in my life. I even signed up for the VFW, but in my town there are no combat vets and its hard for me to find common ground with Air Force techs or USCG vets.

My Bn took a ton of casualties over there, including me. Its painful to come to the realization that the average American doesn’t give a shit what we did. I’m not asking for VA disability, parades, etc. I just wish somebody would say ‘Oh man, I heard you fought in Sangin? What was it like over there?’ I’d love to sit down and tell somebody about the change of seasons, how cold it could get, how beautiful it could be too. I’d love to talk about the funny stuff that happened with my friends, how we were able to secure areas allowing kids to go to school, etc.

In this first interview with Derl Horn, we go over his early childhood, what led him to the Marines, boot camp at Marine Corp Recruiting Depot San Diego, boot camp stories, being the 'grandpa' of his boot camp platoon, and a married Marine moving to ITR, going to Camp Lejeune and Cuba, and then receiving orders to depart for Vietnam. He would be assigned to the 1st Battalion, 9th Marines (1/9) one of the Marine Corps' most legendary battalions with a history from Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima to numerous operations in South Vietnam along the DMZ. In his time with 1/9, he would partake in numerous combat operations, including Operation Buffalo, where Bravo Company would have 57 Marines killed in one day on 2 July 1967.

You’re in country on a security patrol with your squad. Enemy forces are non-uniformed insurgents. You come across a fire team

Your ROEs are strictly HOSTILE ACT/HOSTILE INTENT. 

The enemy knows this, and taunts you and your squad as you’re postured for contact. They know if they so as flag your guys, they get smoked, so they make sure not to. Your Marines are waiting on your command and will follow you either way.

Do you smoke them? It would most likely be completely decisive in your favor. Your squad members are already behind cover sighted in.

USMC,"Regarding OEF and the Afghanistan Papers, some of the major issues in OEF was a complete lack of strategy and terrible professional relationships and communication between high and mid and high level officers. 

To expand, multiple anonymous sources claim there was not a coherent long term strategy in Afghanistan. Also, when mid level officers/battalion commanders would report not everything was going to plan or that things weren’t going well, that they would be posted of command, which lead to commanders giving inaccurate status updates to higher command in fear of being relieved of command, rather than reporting the reality of the situation. 

I know this is a very simplified summary of what happened, but is the USMC and DoD doing anything about this problem?

USMC,"Just curious what we all think. 

I often see high-ranking Marines Officers/SNCOs with 25+ year careers, retire and go on to become senior consultants, paid advisors, and board members for businesses seeking lucrative government contracts. 

Part of me thinks that them using their influence to meddle in the contracting process for the outlay of public funds is antithetical to our core values. It flies in the face of integrity without comprise and is frankly, slimy as hell. 

They are so blatant about it that they'll list the half-dozen companies they associated with on platforms like LinkedIn while also unabashedly pontificating to the rest of us about our core values as though they're doing nothing wrong. 

I put this type of behavior at the same level as congressmen who use non-public information to insider trade or ex-politicians that collect multi-million dollar speaker fees after leaving office.

EDIT: I would also note that this entirely different than those who retire/separate and use their expertise to actually innovate in the private sector.

USMC,"I’ll start of by saying in no way am I trying to attack prior service recruiters as a whole or to pass off blame, this situation was equally my fault as well.

This situation happened to me a earlier this year and to a couple of my coworkers as well (some were even in different branches). Now it’s currently happening to an old friend.

To explain from the beginning, I had just dropped out of the reserves after a mobilization so I could do a private security contract overseas. I was prior active, only went in the reserves to try it out and I luckily got mobilized to do OAW with the refugee crisis.

I knew my contract was about to be over within 8 months but I had intentions to re-enlist in the IRR for personal reasons. ATM it sounded more simpler, and I was able to do it while in a different country.

Long story short, due to complications, I couldn’t and just decided to move on. Until I was contacted by a prior service recruiter, asking if I wanted to re-up since I only had a month left on my contract.

He basically said he could temporarily drop me in a reserve unit and get an emergency extension and drop me out so I can re enlist in the IRR. Since retention is so bad, he said he does it all of the time.

I explained my situation entirely and how I can’t because I’m working in a different country and I won’t be able to check in the unit or make any drills for a year. He said not to worry, I wouldn’t have to make that months drill or the next because the unit was doing AIT in 29 palms and the next month was a blackout (no drill). He will do all of the work and have me in and out. 

I was skeptical but I was desperate. I did it, he said he would do all of the work. Even comforted me by saying this is all legal cause you definitely have to do this process in person.

Well after he dropped me in and 2 weeks go by with no word, I called him to check in. Basically said he was busy so he pushed me to some E-5 career planner that was fresh to the company, knew him when I was in that same company.

I called the company career planner and he had no idea about my situation so I had to explain everything. He said he’ll take care of my emergency extension and my drop out papers simultaneously so I would have to show up for drill. 

2 more weeks go by and I check in again, he basically said he pushed me to S-1 and gave me their office phone (which didn’t work). I saw what was going on and got pissed. I said fuck it and was just gonna wait until my contract was finished, I had other shit to worry about at the time.

3 months go by and I get a called from this aggressive SSGT accusing me of being UA for like 3-4 months and I explained my situation and he then start throwing more charges like falsifying paper work. Apparently if I didn’t show up immediately they would take away my earned benefits and drop my Honorable discharge. So I naturally freaked out.

I called the company 1 sgt and explained everything and he basically calmed me down, and told me he would set a meeting up with the CO/XO. 

During the meeting it was explained to me that my situation just sounded like a huge communication error and they would work with me. Basically they will just drop me out and forget everything, swept everything under the rug.

Not the type of person to blame everything on the Marine Corps but I really felt used in this situation, like just a body to fill someone’s quota. But I do admit I share complete responsibility in this as well.

USMC,"So for context, during World War 2, there are credible sources/accounts that Nazi commanders supplied their troops with pharmaceutical grade methamphetamines to further improve their durability in combat. Historians even credit this as one of the reasons why their “Blitzkrieg” warfare was so effective.

I’ll try and make it short and simple, but for this hypothetical scenario:

The US had been at war with a near peer adversary with extensive combat operations around the globe for the past 2 years.

You’re the Squad leader of a very experienced, yet battle fatigued rifle squad that has been conducting various and rigorous missions for the past 2 months and have yet to be rotated out, you have 1 more crucial mission before rotation.

You’re squad has taken casualties but still combat effective and can still confidently handle anything scenario. But after accessing your Marines welfare, you can blatantly tell that the war has chipped away at their physical, mental, and spiritual well-being and it has taken a blatant toll on moral and you fear the unit’s combat effectiveness.

On your last patrol, you intercepted an enemy recon patrol and terminated the threat. You task one of your TLs to conduct TSE and they found a supply of pharmaceutical grade methamphetamine tablets on the EKIA. You confiscated them because they might assist you and your squad later.

You’re currently conducting rehearsals with your squad after getting a Warn-O for a company night raid on a heavily fortified compound. You remember the meth tablets and consider supplying them to your troops to further increase their combat effectiveness.

Knowing the legal ramifications and penalty under the UCMJ of caught and the moral/ethical issues with drug use… Do you allow your Marines, under their consent, to take these drugs to further increase their combat effectiveness for this specific mission? Why or why not?

USMC,"Ok, crayon eating debil dogs, let's have your best Christmas Story.  I'll start.  After arriving in Somalia for Operation Restore Hope in mid December, the 1st FSSG was parked at the old Embassy Golf Course.  The ISSMO was placed on top the old tennis courts.  We had shipping containers that outlined the permitter, and we had our own private courtyard for ourselves.  Cammi-netting above use and picnic tables for food, it was time for Christmas Dinner.  The call was out for everyone to bring their best poggy bait for family style dinning.  The only thing that was lacking was festive holiday lighting.  So, I found some 6-gauge copper wires and i started making 4-foot-long tiki-torch holders that we could hand int he cami-netting.  These were to hold soda cans with the tops cut off, stuffed full of toilet paper and soaked with diesel fuel.  When you lit them, the flame was 4"" tall and well short of setting anything on fire.  I'm on top of a picnic table hanging these torches, lighting them, the mood was being set when I heard, ""What the hell are you doing?"".  I casually look down and see an Old Marine looking up at me with hands on his hips, and I immediately responded with; ""Hang on buddy, I'll be right with you"" returning my gaze to the magical light of the tiki flame.  Then it dawned on me.  Was it something shinny on his collar?  Was it stars?  Ka-boom, I snap to attention and turned towards General Christmas, who began to ream my ass like no tomorrow.  After a volcano of ass-chewing, my Major stepped in to save me.  The torches were put out and dinner was had, no long-lasting repercussions other than good laughs afterwards.  Fun times.

USMC,"It’s a novel about PTSD, the persistence of memory, existentialism, and the absurdity of war; written by a guy who was in combat during the Battle of the Bulge, was captured by the Germans, and was a prisoner of war in Dresden during the infamous allied fire bombing of the city. 

It uses science fiction as a framing device and it’s super easy to read; if a bit scattered at times, in classic Vonnegut style. 

This passage really impacted me, and it’s one of many: 

&gt;It was a movie about American bombers in World War II and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.

&gt;The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers , and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans though and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new.

&gt;When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again. The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby.",Recommending “Slaughterhouse-Five” by Kurt Vonnegut to all Marines &amp; especially combat veterans,[],r/USMC,0.4086604847302802,0.13814079929807133,0.13814079929807133,0,1,0,0,0,Yarville,-0.0832234605309564,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17,0

So I'm not a professional academic or anything of the sort; I work in the white-collar world and I don't even hold a degree in history. I'm a lifelong History Guy, however, and I've always thought it would be cool to write some sort of popular history (as in, the genre) book about a battle or whatever. 

Finally, in January 2021, I just sat down and started typing. I knew nothing about how to get it published ""for real"" (I was dead-set against self-publishing) or even how to write a long-form narrative. Fast-forward three years and it's about to go to market under an imprint of Casemate, one of the largest military history publishers.

We had a lot of ideas, but stayed away from politics and stuck with something on lines of operational wise.

First, I understand that this is a USMC thread but I am not a marine. I am a Corpsman’s that’s been green for my entire career. I understand the traditions and ways of the Corps more than the Navy. 

I overheard a few young marines that were talking about how they wanted to go to war and couldn’t wait. How they wanted to get a CAR or Purple Heart (Why you would want to be injured is beyond me). I have experienced my fair share, and I of course did not enjoy it. War reminds me of the ultimate sacrifice my brothers and friends made, the broken families, and the forever changed… Although I am still young (29), I feel as if the younger generations day dreams are a old man’s nightmares… 

Should I have sat down and talked to them? 

Why do the younger generations want a piece of chest candy that proves they’re a “man”?

While *all* of the results are viewable with the first link, questions that have user input instead of pre-defined answers are typically displayed very poorly in this view.

[Military Subreddit Census 2023 Results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JxkwKNacCGXIs1Ys-1ppZGl75XFWDh4nsyYGlSbgBbs/viewanalytics)

Welcome back from your research. Here's the deal, I fully realize that this little ~~fetish~~ census is flawed in several fashions. Here's my shit list of all the ways I fucked this year's census up. If any of you have suggestions for next year that I haven't already discussed, hit up my inbox. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

* I only noticed that I didn't include a question asking which branch you're a part of after 13 people already submitted answers. Fixed it live from my phone, but still.
* My dumbass listed warrant ranks as CW-02 instead of CWO-2.
* I busted my own deadlines! Sinceriously sorry about that. I vastly overestimated my bandwidth and writing this up repeatedly fell to the bottom of the to do list.

Anyways, now that I've taken some time to look a bit deeper than face value at all this data here's what I've found.

# Basic Facts

* Y'all made 1,123 submissions. The ratio of branch submissions shaped how most questions were answered. In most charts, the disparity of answers per branch matched the disparity below. I only bothered making my own charts if I saw a trend that broke from this mold.
   * Air Force: 462
   * Army: 258
   * Coast Guard: 85
   * Marine Corps: 69 ^(nice)
   * Navy: 107
   * Space Force: 70 ^(tried too hard for nice)
   * Blank: 72
* I didn't make a chart for the question regarding your unit encouraging attending sick call or medical appointments, but I did notice something unique. The Air Force, Army, Coast Guard, and Space Force all increased in submissions as the likelihood of encouraging attendance increased from 1 to 5. The Navy was about even across 1 to 3, but did have more submissions for 4 and 5 proportional to the other services. Then, the Marine Corps were roughly equal in submissions across all 5! They really are a cult. Look, real talk for a moment. Don't sacrifice your body for your service if you're supporting peace time ops. And if you do, don't chaff getting rated with the VA as if you didn't earn it. Y'all take care of yourselves!
* Also, there were a few questions that I thought were easy pickings for branch comparisons even if the Google Forms results don't show it that way. I've made a little imgur gallery for six of them that y'all can check out [here](https://imgur.com/a/xgKqDEd). Probably fun for the number nerds out there but I'm not sure who else gets down like that, so...

# Generals

* Three of you claim to be generals in our midst! One is plausible... but the other ""two"" I'm not so sure about. While all three ages match (50+), two of y'all are AH-64 Apaches serving as ""Class IX"" employees in the Army, commissioning with a degree in cunnilingus, would rather fight 3x other generals than other ranks, use condoms 24/7 as COVID preventative measures, claimed spanking as their highest form of punishment (though I have a feeling it wasn't punishment for the receiver since their favorite form of supervisors correcting troops without paperwork is using ball gags), and would implement Titty Tuesday if they were \[AH-64 Apache\] For a Day. You know, just your based pervert, basically.
* On second thought I think the plausible one is probably u/SilentD testing the submission form... so no Generals this time around. Don't worry, you can be my Lieutenant General anytime, boo! o7
* Also, there's something to be said about our willingness to pose anonymously as any of the General ranks... but not a single soul nutted up to be a CWO-5. Y'all know you'd get force choked even thinking about it, haha.

# Levels of Punishment

* You know, I think the one who listed 'marriage' and another who listed 'heavy spanking at home' should probably get together.
* More than a couple of you got 'your balls smoked off' or some variation like 'Just had my ass smoked. Made 20-year old me sit down and take a breather like a 45 year old at their first BJJ practice,' lol. I appreciates handling the situation old fashioned and off the books.
* There was a fair amount of extra duty and paperwork for juniors and seniors being on an episode of When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong. Good reads if y'all wanted to grab some shovels.
* The Marine Corps had the lowest 'None' and 'Verbal' responses among the branches, but the highest 'Extra Duty' and 'Administrative Paperwork', with the second highest 'Article 15'. Conversely, the Space Force had the highest 'None'. I think we all saw those coming a mile away, lol.

# THERE I WAS...

I handle the THERE I WAS question Clint Eastwood style through the categories of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. The Good are tales that are lighthearted, funny, or of benefit to the storyteller. The Bad are tales of fucking up somewhere in the chain and leaves a downer taste in your mouth. The Ugly are tales that give me a bit of a cringe as I read them. These responses are cherry picked exactly as submitted; no edits have been made.

* The Good
   * When I first check on my ship they put us in an overflow berthing where marines were supposed to stay. They’re was HUGE dent in one of the bigger stand up lockers. After about a month someone had the video of happened, several marines used a singular marine as a battering ram and slammed his in the locker several times without a helmet. The also broke all of washer and dryers on board in a similar way with the writing of “broken courtesy of the USMC""
   * Baghdad 2007, walk in fresh off the plane, Army Col looks up, sees me, says ""come with me."" Go into a section, he yells for the SFC, who comes running. He tells the SFC, ""This is SSgt XXX, he is your new section chief. Understood!?"" SFC replies yes. I didnt get it then, but within two weeks, it was perfectly clear. On his NCOER, under leadership, I wrote ""the only reason anyone follows this man is to see what he will fuck up next.""
   * I got bitched at by an Air Force E6 for using profanity when talking to other Army E4’s (combat wounded guys in the hospital with me) told we weren’t professionals talking like that…AND THEY (USAF) WERE AUTHORIZED TO WEAR CROCS IN PTS BECAUSE IT WAS HOT
   * \[Editor's Note: I'm not going to put them in here because they're COALITION and not JOINT you numbskulls, but there's several funny short stories about working with other nations if'n you wanted to go diggin'.\]
* The Bad
   * It wasn't a group but I did my Corporal's Course at Henderson Hall in DC. My unit was actually on Fort Meade, MD but this was the nearest we could get for the course. They put us up in army barracks. It was so bad, rats ate through our cammies. We had to hang all our shit from the ceiling otherwise they would chew through it. I lost 3 pairs of pants and a blouse that they had eaten through...
   * I was an Air Force Academy cadet on exchange to the Naval Academy. I can definitely say that my school (Air Force) is a college where we put on uniforms and pretend to be in the military. Navy was a real military academy. There were pros and cons to both. Navy had way better esprit de corps, but Air Force had infinitely more common sense with what seemed like very obvious shit. Case in point. If it's late hours at the Naval Academy and you require medical attention for anything (including emergencies), you are supposed to call the duty officer, have him or her coordinate a ride to the hospital an hour away, have them inform your chain of command, and only then can you actually go to the hospital. If anyone in that chain doesn't pick up their phone... well.. hope the problem isn't \*too\* urgent. The Air Force by contrast, the sequence is; wake up anyone with a car, get to the hospital, and \*then\* figure out who you need to contact for accountability.
* The Ugly
   * There I was in a Joint Command. Of all branches, Army is the only one that does not have a functioning SHARP or EO Program. Someone comes on the net on the watch floor that wanted to file a Sexual Harassment complaint. I had been trying for 6 months to get audience with the CDR with Stars on his chest to let him know about this deficiency, to no avail (because the lack of EO Program meant we didn’t have an Open Door Policy either, as noted by the Element CSM at the time who is now thankfully retired). It was embarrassing that no one in the Army Element anywhere could tell this SM, or the CMSgt in the AF, where our Soldiers could file a complaint to receive help. We’re doing better on the SHARP Program over a year later, but we still haven’t had any presence from an EOA in the Command
   * \[Editor's Note: I won't put any one particular in here to not belabor the point, but damn there are quite a few stories about the Navy's E-O divide, competency, and fitness.\]

# King / Queen for a Day Hits

* \[These were givens, honestly\]
   * B E A R D S
   * Actually releasing for the day when the work is done
   * BETTER PAY HOLY SHIT PLEASE PASS THE 30% JR ENLISTED PAY
   * Homesteading
* If a command doesnt immediately start an investigation into a report of sexual harassment, sexual assault or regular assault the senior person with knowledge of the allegation is relieved for cause.
* Step Promotion is decided by trial by combat.
* Boot bands not being required for some friendly bonding.
* \[Honorable Mention\] Space Force Chief Master Sergeants are now referred to as “Master Chiefs” (Same response I gave in the 2020 census because this is, in fact, the hill I’m willing to die on)
* \[Dishonorable Mention\] Everyone has to watch a season of anime every quarter.

# Branch Retention

* Air Force: 75.96% (Next highest: 7.93% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Army: 29.33% (Next highest: 26.67% Air Force)
* Coast Guard: 75.32% (Next highest: 12.99% I'd go back in time to punch myself in the face)
* Marine Corps: 58.33% (Next highest: 20.00% Air Force)
* Navy: 38.30% (Next highest: 26.60% Air Force)
* Space Force: 61.90% (Next highest: 19.05% Air Force)

So... if you didn't re-pick your same branch, you're likely to cross into the AF. Except if you're already AF or a Coastie, in which case you already know the truth, haha. Also, the Puddle Pirates are only willing to go into the CG, AF, or SF in that order. Zero were willing to cross into the blue, green, or red. When it comes to the Marines, they only branch they refuse to fuck with is the SF. The Navy refuses to join the Marines. And finally, the SF refuses to join the Army or Marines. Makes total sense, but I get a kick out of seeing the instinct we all have validated here.

# Ego: ""I ain't hurtin' no one, so what's it matter?""

When the Marine starts to think the rules aren't beneficial, what others will be broken?

If you're showing your command and peers a lack of self-care, and self-discipline, then what are you gonna try to get away with when NO ONE is looking, hm? That's the worrisome part! That's why everyone's on your butt, man. Do ya get it?  This is a ""red flag"".

If you're lax on trimming on your own damn bushes then how lax are you gonna be clearing out those bushes obstructing your field of fire. If I was your TL, I'd be constantly concerned about you.

# Pride: ""I'm putting out more than them, I deserve a break""

When the Marine starts to think that he's too entitled to tuck his shirt in while he's working because it's hot and he's working on something big and important for the team. Maybe he just got back from a long 7 day mission and he just wants to sit in the chow hall with his gym shirt on. That tells me that you're not always gonna put out 100%. You know there's a time and place for a break, for a gym shirt, for R\&amp;R; but breaking protocols in front of a unit that's bonded on the structure and discipline and uniformity of it's men is not the time and or place. 

Remember the head shaving process, the issuance of the same uniforms for everyone? What about when 1 marine screwed up, do you remember your entire team getting punished along with you? You all lost that right to be a one man band when you joined the Corps! Now you're part of a corps, THE CORPS.

You've heard it said before, but do you really know what esprit de corps means?

It's the feeling of comradery, fellowship, unity and pride all felt by the same group.

But when the Marine starts to not follow the rules like everyone else, they start to etch away at that comradery. A cancer that eats it's own body must be stopped before it spreads

USMC,"BLUF:  need feedback on whether y’all see value in taking everything that works from Reddit’s military subreddits and merging it into a Rally Point-style service that isn’t toxic and actually works.

Hi all, I had originally posted this to r/army, but the subreddit’s rule 3 won’t allow it through. To be clear, this is not an ad for a service, but rather a post to gauge interest in a project I’ve been working on with some friends. Any and all feedback on our idea would be greatly appreciated! 

This idea sparked after observing the mixed feelings within the online military community regarding the Rally Point website. 

To quote a post by u/BrokenRatingScheme:

""It's full of sycophant active duty members and surly, self-important retirees that firmly believe, with the entirety of their being, that their often incorrect opinion is the only one that matters, and the opinion of anyone not in their MOS/below their (retired) rank is worthy of scorn and mob-mentality chastisement.

It's like LinkedIn where everyone senior to you can be as rude and self-fellating as they want, because what are you going to say? You're one GAL lookup away from someone contacting your leadership and letting them know you were perceived as disrespectful. It's an echo chamber social network.""

This, combined with the positive dynamics of r/army, inspired us to create a platform that merges the best of both worlds: the community spirit of the military subreddits with the service member-focused intent of Rally Point.

Our aim is to emulate the app Blind's format, while offering an anonymous and supportive environment. Here’s our current take on the pros and cons of both platforms:

Rally Point:Pros:
* Specifically built for service members.
* [Your input on other positives would be greatly appreciated.]
Cons:
* Toxic culture dominated by rank.
* No anonymity.
* Lacks a supportive environment.
* User interface challenges.
* Overly serious, lacking in community engagement.

Reddit military subreddits:Pros:
* Balances serious discussion and casual interaction.
* Strong, helpful community.
* Anonymity respected.
* no rank games and big-dickmanship
* Effective moderation.

Cons:
* Navigational challenges.
* Valuable discussions can get lost.
* Dependent on Reddit's guidelines.
* no internal navigation to pages or sub-groups for specific needs (like subpages for mentoring/mental health assistance/shitposts/unit specific/MOS specific/post ETS job search etc...)

This list is by no means all-inclusive and I'd welcome any and all input on it.Is this something that you would use/benefit from? And If you all think this is an asinine idea I'd be happy to hear that too, as my ultimate goal is to create a service that people actually want, and feel they could benefit from.

I’ll take a double chicken chalupa with a Coke and  side of Gabagool

TLDR: building an app, is it something you’d be interested in?

USMC,"The Hub is now blocked to all users in NC.

Gentlemen, I bid you farewell. 

""Dear user,

As you may know, your elected officials in North Carolina are requiring us to verify your age before allowing you access to our website. While safety and compliance are at the forefront of our mission, giving your ID card every time you want to visit an adult platform is not the most effective solution for protecting our users, and in fact, will put children and your privacy at risk.

In addition, mandating age verification without proper enforcement gives platforms the opportunity to choose whether or not to comply. As we’ve seen in other states, this just drives traffic to sites with far fewer safety measures in place. Very few sites are able to compare to the robust Trust and Safety measures we currently have in place. To protect children and user privacy, any legislation must be enforced against all platforms offering adult content.

The safety of our users is one of our biggest concerns. We believe that the best and most effective solution for protecting children and adults alike is to identify users by their device and allow access to age-restricted materials and websites based on that identification. Until a real solution is offered, we have made the difficult decision to completely disable access to our website in North Carolina.

Please contact your representatives before it is too late and demand device-based verification solutions that make the internet safer while also respecting your privacy.""","It is the end of times for II MEF...

USMC,"First I understand that its a privilege but hear me out.


Essentially I am transitioning &amp; got a offer to take a 120 day skill bridge internship with General Dynamics.   The only issue is that I have 87 days of leave on the book and the program goes for 120 days. It would start in April &amp; end August 1st my final day of my contract. 

My direct SNCO wants me to be able to use it because he truly thinks that my current unit doesn’t need me as I am not used for anything but the rest of my Chain isn’t too much on board because they want me to “Train my replacement” who would arrive after the start date. Im in one of those units in which we honestly have Marines for the sake of having Marines.  Like that one commander that doesn’t use his Marines but will never admit it because he enjoys the idea of having extras on standby.

Here is where I have a issue.

1. The command I am apart of is Top heavy and as you know in Top Heavy commands Sergeants don’t do much.
2. If I go on skill bridge the command won’t approve my leave and there reasoning for is that Im supposed to use my leave dates for skillbridge which I know is false &amp; their stubbornest will make me have to sell 80+ days when I dont do anything at all.
3.  The Average work day is from 0800 - 1500 and I am serious.  It is literally a ghost town come 1430/1500. On top of that I don’t even do anything. Seriously I spend 90% of the day on youtube because my job is just misc stuff they don’t want to do like organizing files.  It usually two meetings day then every one goes home.
4.  I find it hard to think that they can’t afford to lose but others in the shop can go TAD for sports games.


How should I go about doing this.  I will be putting in 30 days of leave (Sell the rest) &amp; will also be submitting for the 120 day skill bridge but my SNCO told me Im going to have to fight because the command doesn’t like that ideal when again I am not utilized at all.",How to convince my command to let me take skill bridge?

Wife is not pressing charges. She never wanted him arrested. 

He knows his actions are his responsibility and knows too that he done fucked up. This is his 1st negative interaction with local law enforcement. He was arrested and charged with: four felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill; three misdemeanor counts of child abuse; one count of communicating threats; and one count of hit and run failing to report property damage.

**Getting Fit: An Overview**

**Four levers to pull:**

**Training**: this is where you force adaptations in your body to get stronger, gain endurance, etc.

**Nutrition**: this is where you fuel that magnificent beast of a body and lose fat

**Activity**: this is where you stop dying early and help burn calories

**Sleep**: this helps your body recover and benefit from the other levers

**Training**: Try and get in at least one session a week of those four kinds of training:

* *Strength*: this could be barbells or machines at a gym, or pushups, pullups, and air squats at home. It could be Pilates or power yoga—anything where you are doing sets of movement that push your muscles. Don’t stress over particular programs, set/reps, etc. If you do 3-5 “hard sets” (like maybe you had another 1-2 movements in you), for basic movements like squatting down/picking things up, pushing away, pulling towards, lunging forward/sideways, and twisting, you will get stronger.
* *Cardio/Zone 2:* jogging, rucking, powewalking, biking, etc. Half an hour at a moderate pace, like 60-70% of your max heart rate (220-age). Don’t go too hard or you miss the benefit! This is your base of your endurance.
* *Metabolic/HIIT*: bursts of activity that are close to maximal: skipping rope, elliptical, sprinting, etc. The goal is to get your heartrate up very high for working sets, with active recovery in between. I like 30 seconds work/1:30 active recovery. You could do 1 minute on/1 minute recovery, etc. But something like an 8-9 on a scale of 1-10 for work, and then drop to a 5-6 for the recovery period.
* *Mobility*: just go to youtube and find a 20-30 minute routine you like (Julia Reppel and Tom Morrison are good).

**Nutrition**: This can be overwhelming, and in a culture where we are surrounded by tons of crappy food. Some manageable suggestions:

Focus on getting in good food. When you eat high quality food, you will be less likely to eat crap. Also, good fuel will help you train, recover, and improve your body.

*Eat whole foods instead of processed foods; cook as much as you can instead of take-out*. Think of Panera and McDonalds as poison dispensaries; fruit juice, granola bars, breakfast cereals, store-bought muffins, breads, and cakes are all pretty much posion. Poison, poison, poison. Replacing poison with nuts, drinking milk, searing proteins like fish and chicken, eggs, cheese, broccoli/Brussel sprouts/cabbage, etc. is a huge move in the right direction.

*Don’t kid yourself*: it doesn’t matter what some calorie counter/TDEE website says. Over the course of a week, scales aren’t informative, but over the course of months they are. If you are not gaining muscle and want to, add a small portion of food daily. If you are not losing fat and to, cut out a small portion of food daily. Reassess every two weeks and cut/add as needed.

*Cut out some obvious crap*: empty-calorie drinks like soda or caramel-frappalacho iced vente w/ extra pump+cream, potatoe chips/fries, ice-cream, etc. Set a boundary you can follow, e.g. you will have 2-scoops of ice cream once on the weekend, a peppermint latte w/ extra sprinkles. The important thing is to identify something clear you can cut out to reduce calories in (assuming you want to loose fat)—“eat less” will never work, but cutting out the mid-AM hostess snack cake daily will.

*If you drink alcohol, consider setting clear bounds to reduce consumption*, e.g. if you have a couple beers most nights, set a clear rule that you will only have 3 beers total Fri-Sat.

**Activity**: very simply, a sedentary lifestyle is deadly. Every hour you spend on the couch watching Netflix chips away at your life and health, while every hour walking/gardening/doing chores/playing with your kids is life-extending/improving. Find a way to move more often: go for a 30 min walk after dinner.

**Sleep:** Find a way to get in sleep: a cool room, no lights, calm before you go to bed, no using the bed for anything other than sleeping (and makin’ whoopee), regular bedtime—whatever it takes.

USMC,I never understood why there are no toilet stalls in boot camp like any guy would be used to and would expect anywhere else. But my buddy a former DI was saying the toilet/bathroom set up (dozens of toilets in a row without doors or even stalls) is intentionally designed this way to break in and toughen up the the shy and nervous young men recruited and build comradery amongst them. He said at first all the guys are embarrassed and anxious but you later adjust as you realize you are all guys here and all the guys are doing the same thing (this has been my experience). He said after boot camp you earn your privacy and can use a toilet stall but for the new guys recruited this teaches them their place and gets them to fall in line. Is this why the toilets are set up like this? Did anybody else have a hard time adjusting? How did you adjust?

USMC,"&gt;The Justice Department announced \[26dec23\] that is has secured a settlement against Billy Joe Goines, owner and operator of Goines Towing &amp; Recovery, based near Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, to resolve allegations that he violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) by towing and then selling vehicles without disclosing to the court that they were owned by servicemembers. \*\*\*  
&gt;  
&gt;In a complaint filed on March 3, the United States alleged that Goines auctioned off, sold or otherwise disposed of motor vehicles owned by eight servicemembers in violation of the SCRA, which provides a wide variety of financial and housing protections to members of the military. The SCRA requires a towing company to file an accurate affidavit stating whether the vehicle’s owner is in military service (i.e. a military affidavit) before it can get a court judgment authorizing it to sell a stored vehicle. If it appears that a vehicle’s owner is in military service, the court may not authorize the sale of the vehicle until it appoints an attorney to represent the interests of the servicemember. If that attorney then requests a postponement of the matter, the court must grant that request and postpone the case for at least 90 days.  The complaint here alleges that Goines either failed to file or filed inaccurate military affidavits with the court. Goines also allegedly filed military affidavits stating that he was unable to tell whether a vehicle owner was in the military even in instances where the vehicle at issue was towed from a military installation or had military decals, and instances when the vehicle owner or owner’s spouse had informed Goines of the owner’s active military service.\*\*\* [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-north-carolina-based-towing-company-resolve-violations)

Second off can spouses use the gym on base?

Third, for life as a 0352 boot in the fleet what can day to day life be like? What will I do in a typical work day? when will the work day end? How much time will I have to myself to do the things I want? How often will we go to the field? 

Ive heard horror stories about the fleet are they true? 

Also for anyone who knows, what will IWC be like? Particularly for 0352s. How often will we go to the field, how long are the work days, what’s some good knowledge to know now.

However, as I continued to read I realized that the way he was detailing what he saw life to be had indications that he was dealing with hallucinations. He would constantly battle with the fact that none of these haunting events that he imagined was real and that it was all in his head. Depression is a terrible illness and I think almost anyone with any mental illness tends to have a comorbidity with it. I’m surprised that no one has picked up on the cues that Ren Hang might’ve been schizophrenic or have schizoaffective disorder.

schizophrenia,"Just want to drop some lines for today is Christmas.

So many of you now sit in a dark place and feel all lost and cast out. Others have a good time today, and we all sit there with the madness or the memories of. It can feel a lot like being discarded and rejected for the pains one has to bear. Like being punished twice for something that wasn't one's fault to begin with.

Well, I just want to tell you all today, don't give yourself up because of that. Don't let people belittle or disregard you because of the experiences you had. These experiences are all valid experiences. They are tough hardship, and even when other people can't see it we all struggle with this hidden suffering and have to get by.

We are all valid survivors of that hardship. We can be proud of getting through that and still being alive. People just have a hard time to recognize - if we were paralyzed, had lost a limb or sight or hearing, then people could recognize our hardship. The hardship we have in the mind they can't see. Some people fail to understand our situations completely, or just fear it too much, others follow an instinct to account the suffering to our persons, and this can really hurt and make one feel alone and lost with the suffering at times.

That's why we have to make up our hearts and realize and accept that this suffering is not visible but still there and valid. This is why people with experience need to stick together and raise awareness. Overcoming barriers of silence and working for the recognition of our pains. Many people already recognize, and understand that we are valid in our struggles. The experiences we have to make...they are the most humbling you can have, the most agonizing, also hard to see from the outside. And this is what makes us especially valid, because nothing makes you tougher and wiser in the end than what we have to go through.

So I want you to take this now into tonight, and try to make it a good night somehow even when others can't see that validity. You know in your heart you're valid and what you've gone through, you know you deserve all respect for that hardship. When others can't see it right, then you have to admit that to yourself.

Even when you're in a dark place, I hope you will not lose trust in life and keep working your way ahead. You know, you don't need to be the uberman to do that. You just need to be open minded and on the look for the chances you have in your life, and then step by step by step making these things real. And it's all there, this world may seem dark at times but the beginnings for trying to make it better are everywhere around us. We just have to look into our heart, around us, and listen to those who bring us the awareness of what we can do to make the best out of our lives still in our bad situation.

You know, there are often things in the way to that. The worst enemy to getting better I found is the thought of expectations that others and the world seems to have from people like us like from everyone. These expectations together with the silence about our pains are what can make us feel so dark at times, with the feeling we could never meet the standards we have to think of. Try to think differently today - we are not in this world, to live up to anyone's expectations, neither the others are there to live up to ours.

We are not really obliged to anything by our heart other than trying to get happy and lucky however we can. Noble is then, when you not only seek your own happiness, but also that of others and take the responsibility for it. This is probably everything our nature truly obliges us to, that's the freedom to follow our heart and learn from wherever it takes us. This is the point, when you realize after dropping some of the expectations you feel pressing you down, that you still can do a lot and follow your dreams and the good things from the present and past you find in your heart. It's all there for us, and whatever we do out of it will be a valid experience, no matter what other people say about it, no matter how many voices are dragging us down. The heart can and will still spark up these dreams for us to take up and follow, and I found, when we take our time and really follow them from heart, they can be stronger than the delusions, they can make us overcome them and reconnect to other people and still find fulfillment in our lives even when we thought all our previous dreams were broken down to shards. This is not just some empty words, but my own experience from more than 20 years with the diagnosis.

So, I hope these words can take some load of someone's chest tonight, and make you feel a little better about the situation. I know this situation can be very bad, but you're not alone with it, and when you just keep going and looking for new beginning you can maybe also find some threads to pick up and weave a new life out of it. It's Christmas today, so do something good for yourself and if you can and dare, also for another one, to bring back some hopes for a new beginning in the next year.

So I wish you all a merry Christmas, or a merry non-Christmas if you chose to reject the santa merchandise...hell, it's your right to do so, to celebrate or not, and it's still special days that you can use to give yourself some space for your heart. Hope you have people around you who make you feel valid, and if you're alone, I wrote this to tell you you're valid nonetheless!",Schizophrenia is a valid experience,[],r/schizophrenia,0.1964410813768935,-0.06290699815754695,-0.06290699815754695,0,1,0,0,0,disregard_delusion,-0.2854965236930938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,13,6

schizophrenia,"I just woke up from 8 hours of sleep which felt like two weeks of living different horrific scenarios. From when I can remember , I was always schizophrenic, however when I was a child , I was not on medication and didn't receive any help . My parents just assumed that I had very weird imagination, every day since I can remember I was expieriencing horrific gruesome and straight up weird nightmares every night and it felt like I was stuck in these nightmares for days rather than hours. 

These nightmares can vary from needing to escape police to my family being brutally murdered. I have seen my partner dead and mutilated in my nightmares, my family members decapitated, often  these nighmares visually look like a bad lsd trip (not like I ever took lsd, but that's what I imagine it would look like). The most terryfing part of these nightmares for me is the fact that it feels like ages, I cannot escape and I am stuck living threw fake life which is just horrible. I wake up crying and covered in blood from huge nose bleeds often after such nightmares. There are rarely situations where I can sleep peacefully but when there are ,then I cherish these peaceful nights. I am chronically sleep deprived, I am mentally drained and scared every time after waking up from these nightmares ,I don't even know what to do, I guess that's why I am texting strangers about it .

also

I took various medication for sleep, schizophernia, antypsychotics etc. and none of them work on me , if anything they make things worse and cause me to expierience psychosis.

I went to several psychiatrists and neurologists, none of them ever helped me.

schizophrenia,"new to this sub, recently processing the idea that i am developing schizophrenia, and it scares me

my memory isn't great, but from what i am able to remember i have had visual+audible hallucinations and some strange delusions since 15. there would be days where i would just lay on the floor for hours because the whole room was spinning and many overlapping voices. there would even be days where i wouldn't sleep because i saw a man watching me. im almost 18 now and the voices are becoming more frequent. before it used to be incoherent babbling, but now i can hear them say sentences. they keep asking if i can hear them. i try not to engage because i think that will make them speak more. it's honestly distressing and i don't know what to do from here. 

ive been seeing a therapist and monitoring them and what they are saying. doing this makes me aware of how often they come around. and sometimes thinking about it too much makes them show up more.

im not sure if i have a family history because im disconnected from my father's side, but i do have a trauma history that may cause it (if thats how that works)

schizophrenia,"I’m not sure how to write this, feels very personal and also kind of hard to describe, but here goes…

 I am non-binary and diagnosed schizophrenic. I feel very certain that I am non-binary, but I just can’t seem to come out to people and insist on my identity. The reasons follow:

 I often feel like I don’t exist. Both in terms of not “representing myself”(?), but also like I *really* am invisible or dead already or just not here or between worlds/dimensions. I often feel misunderstood or paranoid. I sometimes get this weird feeling in my body, like I am thirsty, need a hug, my back itches and like I am violated, all at the same time. I’m not sure exactly how dysphoria feels for others, but I am sure, I have experienced it somehow. I change style and hair so often, that people can’t recognize me, which makes me feel even more invisible (also in a literal sense). I feel empty on the inside, like there’s a total dark, quiet room inside of me - which made me think there’s no way I can identify with a certain binary gender (I identify as agender). But also my schizophrenia results in me dissolving everything into nothing and everything at the same time, if that makes sense? So I’m just confused. And maybe none of this even makes sense.

I could go on and on with symptoms, but anyways, I just can’t seem to seperate what is gender identity, and what is my schizophrenia, which makes me question how to come out to my friends and family. It’s hard to insist on having a certain identity, when you feel that you are literally non-existent??",Schizophrenia and gender,[],r/schizophrenia,-1.0768753387434293,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,finetine,-0.3192087008867834,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,6

The problem for me right now is when my girlfriends feels sad or she feels a psychosis coming or anything else like that, the only solution she can think of is me being there. The problem with that is im the type of person that likes my solitude and playing video games with my friends and stuff like that. I should mention that her psychosis isnt ''that bad''. What i mean by that is that she is not violent, dosent wander outside, usually just falls asleep after 10 minutes. However she hallucinates 7/10 times. Both visually and auditory. I dont know what to do and how to not feel like an asshole telling her that i need to be home. How do i go about this? How can i make her feel better from my home? And am i an asshole for saying no?

schizophrenia,"      I (15)F was just recently diagnosed with schizophrenia. I have a feeling a lot of people are going to say I'm to young to get the diagnosis, but at this point I'm not even in early stages, I have the symptoms of someone who would have had it for years now. And no obviously it didn't happen over night.
      I've been full on panicking since I got the diagnosis, I feel the hallucinations and delusions have gotten worse bc I can't stop thinking about it. A year of doctors appointments, so many diagnosis. I prepared myself for all the possibilities. When schizophrenia crossed my mind, I didn't really read too much into it. A lot of my problems were blamed on other illnesses and childhood .
     My family sucks at keeping theses things to themselves especially if they could get the attention from other people. Too many people already know. Right now I'm doing online school, but I start public school again in 11ish days. I don't know who I'm supposed to tell or if some students are going to have to know in case I have a episode. I don't want other people to hear and think I'm crazy. I'm not crazy.
      This next part is going to really show the schizophrenia in me, but I'm scared. What if I'm the only real one and I'm in a simulation. And the goal is to not let people take other me. If I get on the medication it will shift my mind. I think the government knows I know too much. I've finally figured out what they've been doing. Or what if I'm not real and everyone else is. Maybe I'm a clone. I am a remake of somebody else who died. Is my brain my own??
      I have so many superstitions. I really do think I know to much and I don't know who to trust. Nothing feels real anymore. I know I haven't always been like this but I can't remember what it was like when I wasn't. Why can't I be normal. Why do I have to be the one to fight against the government. 
      Honestly at this point it's making me want to relapse on self harm or suicide. I just want to feel real. And if I am schizophrenic, I know I will be put into an institution eventually, and I don't want to go to places like that anymore. 
      If you've read my last posts, I've been in mental hospitals bc they were trying to see why I was the way I am.
      This is really hard to accept because I've had big dreams and everything is going down hill. Do any of you have schizophrenia or help people who do? I really need some advice and maybe just some details on what my life could look like from now.

schizophrenia,"I've been diagnosed with psychosis but I don't know if it's full-blown schizophrenia or a schizoaffective disorder.

I'll try to keep it short. I think there are cameras in my wall and I think I saw a lense once. I'm scares of mirrors and they must be avoided or faced away from me if possible. I think people are always watching me. Always following me. When I hear laughing, it's about me. The government knows I have powers. I am a god, an alien, or an angel. I think everything has a meaning and an constantly trying to decipher it. Back in 2021-2022, I became obsessed with spirit numbers, 111 and 333 and 222 and so on. I would hallucinate these numbers. I would see blobs of color and messages in the air. They were meant for me. I'd also see random words and numbers. I see shadow faces and sparkles of white. I have visual snow syndrome though, so it could be that.

I have horrible mood swings. I sleep for 11-14 hours each night. I've been irritable my whole life but it's getting worse. I'm so on edge. My therapist said I have stress and anxiety that is so bad, my body has normalized it to the point where I can't discern it. I used to have false memories and extremely vivid dreams that I thought were memories. I had severe ocd and would wear multiple layers of gloves, wash my hands until they bled, and when it was really bad, I couldn't breathe a certain way or wouldn't touch a certain part of my bedframe while I slept. I would apologize to God and sob over the Bible. I'd force myself to smile. I'd pour bleach on my skin. I'd shower for hours. Laundry became a 5-hour process because I had to move clothes a certain way. It was hell.

Along with ocd, I've also been diagnosed with autism, schizoid pd, depression, anxiety, panic attack disorder, and we suspect I have ADHD.

Mentally, I feel like a child. I was born into a household that was a quiet type of abusive. I thought it was fine, but my adolescence was horrible. My parents were strict and gave me trauma that I suppressed.

Now my memory is bad. I forget things after a few seconds and I take it to mean my brain is trying to protect me by rejecting unnecessary information.

Right now, I have a hard time socializing. I can't speak right. I stutter and say the wrong words. I can't type right. I'm a writer but my hands will sometimes type the wrong thing that my brain thinks.

I don't know. Is this schizophrenia? I've been through 8 therapists and they say it's severe anxiety mixed with autism and ocd. I'm planning to meet with my psychiatrist soon to discuss meds. I'm on Zoloft and Abilify bit it's not helping. I've tried so many meds.

I've never taken drugs, so this is likely stress-related. Is it schizophrenia? It's really ruining my life. And would anyone recommend some coping strategies? Please don't say meditation. It's too hard for me.

schizophrenia,"This is more a vent because I’m really worried about her.

TRIGGER WARNING: these paragraphs contain suicide and self harm

My aunt (40F) used to be such a happy person. She loved hanging out with me and we used to have so much fun together.

She’s getting worse. When she was just diagnosed with schizophrenia she couldn’t really talk to me she was just kinda staring into space.

She has a voice in her head and the voice in her head is Jesus. Jesus tells her that she is in a relationship with him. 

She tried to break up with her husband because she doesn’t want to be unloyal to Jesus. She has committed the 1st suicide attempt by an overdose to be with Jesus. When it didn’t work she was set to hospital and I saw her face it was completely purple. When it didn’t work she tried cutting herself and trying to hit a major artery

She tells me and my family who’s going to heaven and hell because Jesus has told her, apparently I’m going to heaven and her parents are going to hell.

She has tried to commit suicide once again and she got sent to a mental hospital which she has escaped multiple times and ran out bare foot. 

I just hate to see her struggling and my cousins are her children, I feel really bad for them to see their mother in such a bad way.

So my aunt can’t spend Christmas with her family and I just feel so awful for her. I know it’s for a good reason tho.

I just needed to get this out because I’ve been crying so much because I care about her as she’s cared about my many years, we used to be so close and she’s not herself anymore she used to be so bubbly and happy and o went to visit her and she’s as skinny as anything she looks so poorly ",My aunt has schizophrenia and she’s really getting worse,[],r/schizophrenia,0.6739347389220144,-0.12992293064275304,-0.12992293064275304,0,1,0,0,0,Brightskies321,-0.25178434649940423,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,15,5

And at first I was asking if she wants me to come visit her next week and then I changed my mind and told her maybe two weeks from now I'll come
Then she said ""God will make you come sooner I know it"" and my heart broke. I didn't say anything and just said let's see how this week goes.

And honestly she said a few things about God and the friendship we have, and that she was praying to God and that I am the answer

 she is not aware at all of hers and thinks that she's okay and only has depression and anxiety and that's it.

schizophrenia,"Hey everyone, I just made this account to ask a question that’s been on my mind that my psych hasn’t helped me address yet. I looked over the about section and FAQs so I hope I didn’t miss anything that would violate the guidelines! I am also on the mobile site so I apologize for any weird formatting errors.

To start, I am not diagnosed with schizophrenia but I am diagnosed bipolar and harm-type OCD. I am on two different medications to treat these respective diagnoses, but my OCD meds are anti-psychotics that are very rarely ever prescribed for OCD and are more common for schizophrenia and symptoms that relate to such. These meds do help, but I think my psych is a bit lost on “what” I might actually be. 

The reason I say this is because I experience (what I think are) delusions, although my descriptions of such might sound more like hallucinations. (Trigger Warning Ahead) It starts when I become very paranoid that there are bugs in my walls (a big OCD trigger for me) and devolves into me “seeing” the walls moving or pulsating to the motions of the bugs or “hearing” the bugs moving in them. The reason for the quotes is because I’m not sure that I “see” or “hear” these as much as I sort of feel them doing that, if that makes sense. Once I hit this stage, I can either stay in that paranoid/delusional state or it can worsen and I become much more paranoid about other things— like people following me, trying to hurt me, or that bugs have now spread to anything I touch. Basically I don’t feel safe anywhere, even my feet touching the ground or any surface makes me want to vomit or scream, and I don’t trust anyone around me, even my partner who I very much love. 

I guess I’m just wondering how you can tell the difference between hallucinations and delusions? I think I do “see” or “hear” things, but I’ve heard people who are diagnosed with schizophrenia describe auditory or visual hallucinations and they seem much more intense than what I experience. 

I know this is a general question but any insight would be super appreciated, especially because I’m kind of anxious about talking to my psych more deeply about it. Usually when I bring it up, she opts to up my meds and the conversation ends there.

schizophrenia,"Does anyone else here find the mornings the most difficult part of the day? 

I used to love mornings but lately they're quite challenging. 

I think it might be because my night-time Risperidone has worn off and my morning dose needs a bit of time to kick in, but I always find the first few hours of the day the hardest. It mostly seems to be my energy levels that are affected, I just feel slow and dead in the mornings, but I also feel more anxious and sometimes a little paranoid depending on the day. 

It almost feels like each day I have a mountain to climb, I start off the mountain feeling crappy, then over the first couple of hours of the day I climb up to alright, then by hour 4-5 or so I'm feeling decent, and on good days by hour 7-9 I'll be feeling *good*. Once I'm there I usually stay there for the rest of the day until something happens to throw off my mood, which means every night I'm always dreading going to sleep, because in the night I'm feeling pretty good usually, but at the same time I know the good feeling I have will be gone again in the morning and I'll have to make the climb again.

It's one of the reasons I'm struggling to give up smoking again because in the past I started off weaning off the cigarettes by delaying my morning cigarette as long as possible - but recently my mornings have been rough and those first couple of cigarettes feel like the one thing getting me through it.

schizophrenia,"hi all,

i’m a fictional author and always trying to include diverse representation in my books. my current work-in-progress is a romance told from the POV of the female main character who falls for the male main character who has schizophrenia. The book is not about the MMC’s schizophrenia, but it is a rather small subplot which i want to be as accurate as possible.

I’ve read through this subreddit a LOT and I have a few unanswered questions:

For those of you that are medicated/in therapy, what are your day to day “symptoms” (forgive me if this is poor terminology)?

Those of you in relationships, what are the best ways your partners have supported you? (Or ways that partners made things harder for you?)

&amp; any other advice I should know? (i.e. poor representations you’ve seen before/things I should avoid?) 

I appreciate this greatly. I can read all day in the DSM-5 or in research journals, but nothing is better than advice straight from the very people I’m attempting to represent. 

To those who reply, if the book gets published (I’m optimistic that it will, but in traditional publishing you never really know), any comments that I utilize in creating this story will get a PM upon completion &amp; I’ll send you a free copy of the novel :)))

Thanks, friends.

schizophrenia,"Hello,

I don’t know if I have this post tagged right, I apologize if it’s not.  I have some questions and I could really use some advice from people who have experience.

My partner recently had a pretty severe psychotic episode with delusions and hallucinations that landed him in the hospital.  We previously thought he had bipolar disorder, but the doctors thought otherwise after what they observed.  He was communicating to aliens, god, getting messages from tv shows, among other things.  He claimed he was channeling aliens, angels, demons.  Yelling in loud voices and shaking around, laughing hysterically at random points.  Then he’d just stare and not respond, occasionally shaking his head or nodding, chuckling — he was communicating with them, he said.  He’d go through periods of really intense negative emotion, happiness, and no emotion — according to him.  At one point he said he was channeling my spirit that was a demon trying to turn into an angel.  Eventually it subsided to a point that was less outwardly visible, but says the aliens/angels are testing him and making him a better person.  They told him not to lie and are making him tell me things that he has been lying to me about for like over 10 years.  I don’t want to go into details, but I’m reeling because I remember the incidents he’s telling me and remember thinking he was lying to me at the time.  I feel sick and feel like I’m in shock.

My question is, I guess — is it possible for his delusions to cause him to become more honest, like compulsively almost, because he says they’re making him a better person and making him tell the truth?  I’m so confused right now.  And the mood swings and staring off into the distance and not responding are scaring me.

He has an appointment with his psychiatrist soon.  He still doesn’t know what’s going on and I don’t think he can really consider that he could be sick.  I’m not sure how to help him right now.  I have a mental illness myself and I feel like I’m losing my sanity.

I’m not judging him, I realize this is rough.  I feel so bad for him.  :(

schizophrenia,"I’m a young teen and from the age of 13 I started doing drugs like marijuana, vaping, alcohol and eventually shrooms, I am now 9 months sober but after a few months of smoking weed I started having absolutely brutal psychotic episodes. I’m not sure if they are but I looked up the symptoms for example one of them is “religious delusions” which I usually get each episode, my first episode was probably my worst one it went like this. I was in the bathroom smoking weed and I just wanted to get buzzed as usual so I only took one hit, then a few minutes later it kicked in and it was super strong, I only had one hit so either I got laced with something or my brain just gave up on my weed tolerance, the thing is it took days to go away. When I got home I started getting really agitated for no reason and started pacing back and forth, and I started thinking that there was cameras in my room but I noticed from thinking so much my very ability to think was “fading away” and I somehow convinced myself that I had to make a deal with the devil to get my ability to think back, so I continued to pace back and forth in front of my bed and that was the last thing I remembered, after that I woke up 3 days later on my bed with my laptop open on YouTube, also it was a school week and I lived with my parents so I have no idea what happened because usually my mom would force me to go to school.

Then after that I dated my crush that asked me out, but I was still in that episode that I was in when I broke up with my ex, when I got with my crush the episode got worse, I began cutting my hands until they looked mutilated and started drinking my own blood, not only that the whole time I was with him I showed no emotion whatsoever and had this traumatized shell shocked look on my face and walked like a robot with extremely good posture, not only that I failed all my classes and payed little attention to them. After I broke up with my boyfriend I felt true happiness and relief for some reason even though I have had a crush on him for over a year, I have talked to a few psychiatrists about this and they have said that it could be schizophrenia or borderline personality disorder I don’t think I have any of those but what I do know is that I have depersonalization disorder but let me know what you think.",Regularly getting psychosis episodes does this lead to schizophrenia?,[],r/schizophrenia,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,Oakly421,-0.3192087008867834,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,6,1

schizophrenia,"Hi guys,  


I was diagnosed with Schizophrenia 6/7 years ago, I had awful delusions and hallucations, I didn't know what was real and what wasn't, my whole personality changed to try and face the new 'reality' that I was living in. However, with a combination of CBT, Ariprazole, Risperidone and Quetiapine (Not al at once, jesus) I managed to crawl my way out of the delusions, and the hallucinations without the delusions are an irritant at worst.  


But I'm still struggling with the negative symptoms 4/5 years later, I thought the emotional issues were potentially a defence mechanism that my brain would eventually repair, but they're still occuring.   


Let me describe what I'm experiencing now:

  
\- Incredibly low ""social battery"", after 30-60 minutes of conversation, my social battery feels completely empty, I can't think of things to say, I can't join in on any jokes, I pretty much go completely non-verbal for 30 minutes until I recharge, in a group this is fine, but 1 on 1 it makes for pretty awkward situations  


\- Emotional blunting/severe apathy, unless I'm intoxicated, I don't feel any emotion towards what people say or do, I don't get defensive, I don't get upset, I don't get offended, I don't find things funny, I don't express gratitude or love properly, I don't express concern etc. Outwardly I can still express these emotions in pantomine, but some people see straight through me and I can come across as fake or ingenuine. Before the schizophrenia I was a very emotionally intelligent and outwardly displaying person, but now I feel like a borderline psychopath emotionally.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sleep issues, I have never been able to sleep correctly, and can only sleep when I'm on brink of passing out from exhaustion. I've managed to get a 12-8 shift at my 9-5 to allow me to fall asleep at 4/5am without major consequence, but I would like to get some insight on this, and see if it's a result of the negative symptoms or just a personal thing, as I've had trouble with sleep ever since I was a child  


I would be interested to know if anybody has faced these same negative symptoms, and potential solutions to properly mitigate them. The fact that I tend to be okay emotionally when I'm intoxicated makes me think there's some sort of psychological block there, but on the other hand, the increased confidence could just improve my self deception. Either way, this tends to make me use alcohol and substances as a crutch when socialising, which I could do without.

schizophrenia,"My parents born had an abusive father, and I’d say, even though my mother has only been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, that both have mental health issues. I have heard them both complain about “gangstalking” multiple times in the past and overheard them argue over/about someone else having set them up (they have accused one another of doing this before.) My mother more recently (like a few nights ago) played a video of sounds really loudly and then told my father when he asked that it was for the neighbors who she and my father have sworn were shining a light in their faces before or making noises/doing things with specific intent of intimidating them (the lights - like lights being shone in faces - have specifically come up often.)  

My mother has always seemed quite “normal” in the past to people my parents have encountered, particularly when I was still in elementary school (though I am almost nineteen now.) My father has always been an alcoholic, but I remember my mother in particular seemed much happier and more vibrant when I was little even though she admitted more recently that people used to say she was “crazy.” My mother spends a lot of time watching conspiracy videos, this started years ago but I particularly noticed it over quarantine

He is on medication for something now but I actually don’t know what, he has always tended to talk a lot about the past and it kind of saddens me how off he seems now.

The problem is, he's an alcoholic who said he wants to give up alcohol but that only lasted a day. 

He's since kept drinking and having episodes where he says it's not working and threatens to leave the country again. I think he's taking the meds but can't confirm. He is renting an airbnb and is alone all the time. His mom is not able to care for him.

schizophrenia,"Hello,

My wife has noticed I have good and bad cycles. Ups and Downs. During the downs I’m very withdrawn, inward, and suspicious. During the ups I’m just pretty normal. 

She’s noticed some signs about to have a down. I thought this was interesting and just wanted to share.

1) I’ll get very opinionated and argumentative 

2) I stop really focusing on the current and new and focus more on like existing I guess? Idk she said I get really philosophical and interested in the way the universe is swirling around me and like brushing my teeth. 

3) I either stop eating as much or eat way more. During an up I’ll eat pretty healthy and a lot of different things. When I’m down I eat more hearty comfort meals and nostalgic things that remind me of my childhood.

4) I will do things that bring me a lot of comfort. I’ll start the harry potter series over or lord of the rings. When I’m good I’ll seek out new books.

5) I’ll get really religious when I’m starting to decline too.

schizophrenia,"I’ve been diagnosed for more than a decade and at a fairly good level of medication where I don’t get too symptomatic and I’m not too doped out. I do get some symptoms though and I’ll often just leave social situations when they start kicking in. I’ll give a few examples. I was at a friends and she cooked me dinner then after we ate I kept hearing her ask me why I was there. So I left. I was at a party having a conversation with a couple then another person cut in and started talking to them and I perceived her making comments about me. So I left the party. I was hanging out with two other people watching YouTube and stuff on tv, I got delusions that whenever I touched my face or moved my hands or feet that one of the other people were telling me to do that and I’d only notice after I’d done it. So I left. It’s not necessarily that the thing that got me to leave was so so bad but at this point I just don’t want to fight through symptoms in social situations so I just bail.

schizophrenia,"I want to preface by saying I currently see a psychiatrist for different things (ASD,ADHD,GAD and MDD). I also have background knowledge in the topic. 

I will also preface, I am NOT looking for a diagnosis or expecting a “magic answer” I’m just looking to compare experiences , familiarities, hear stories etc , to better make sense of my situation. 

Post: 


For the last 6-12 months I have been having lingering depression, which as per my MDD and ASD is not a foreign concept. However this recent period of depression has been without the normal mood components, no suicidal ideation no loss of self worth etc, they are all anhedonia, lethargy and poor self care related + executive dysfunction. I’ve been distancing myself and not wanting any interactions apart from necessary ones (not bizarre given my Autism but it’s more frequent, also could just be burnout).. 

During this time my anxiety has been playing up, when I go to the gym I am paranoid everyone is looking at me and talking about me, staring at me and laughing at me. 

This also happens at work , where I think people are laughing at me, communicating between eachother non verbally and don’t like me. 

At times I also periodically get paranoid my neighbours can see me showering and I sometimes hear noises resembling that thought (window opening, lock noise or a laugh). (Rarely). 

I also get anxious about my air con vent that someone is looking through it (however this was prominent in my teens and was severe so I slept under the blanket for months). 

I have also been noticing more visual illusions, by this I mean in my peripheral vision I sometimes see objects that will periodically take a shape of a person until I look at them centrally and it’s normal. Or sometimes I’ll see floating dots around. (My vision and eye health is fine as per the optometrist) Sometimes I get paranoid I may have seen a human figure too until I look at “them” and it’s nothing or a door for example. (These have been getting more frequent, I’m aware illusions are normal but with their increasing frequency and “severity”)..  they also sometimes take the form of just being shadow spots or a sensation someone has walked behind me.

When walking to my car at night I sometimes get paranoid I’m being followed and sometimes think I hear foot steps following me (assuming this could be an anxiety response). 

Very recently I’ve started laughing out loud to thoughts that come into my head, and sometimes my thoughts just don’t make sense, the other day I made a joke in my mind I was the beacon of truth- that made me laugh out loud lol. (This could also be a self soothing thing with my ASD). 

Further , I’ve been having increasing Deja vu , like every day sometimes multiple times a day. Like a situation or string of words was something that happened before , and preceded a bad event or something bad happening. Almost like a sense of doom but mild.

How was everyone else’s prodrome? Any comparisons/similarities? 

I am aware these symptoms could also overlap with burnout from my ASD, anxiety exacerbating these concerns and my depression being in the background. (? MDD with psychotic features etc). 

I was intrigued at Schizophrenia due to reading a few study’s of the slightly increased % of ASD people in likelihood to develop schizophrenia.

Now I understand that my reaction was terrible but I was in shock and extremely upset. As I have been living abroad for quite some time, I didn’t see the change of his psyche and my family did not want to worry me, this was a lesson to all of us of the importance of communication. 

I had such a diverse mix of emotions: I was angry that he would say something so terrible, I was upset that he was unwell, and that my family kept his condition a secret, and I felt some kind of grief for the loss of his sanity. After crying for two hours I told my mom and grandma about what he said to me and they told me that he had been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and that his symptoms are getting worse (it was mainly caused by frequent seizures and long term consumption of medications). My grandma also told me about his other delusions and hallucinations and honestly it was very upsetting to hear, my grandma is a hero for taking care of him.

My vision was turning black, I held on to a cabinet struggling to get up. Did I almost faint?  If so it didn't feel like the normal type of faint, idk it's hard to describe, but I never felt like that before, it was scary. I was feeling completely normal that day, there was no warning signs, it just instantly happened. If I was driving I would of ended up in an accident for sure.

I stopped taking invega (tapered off) 9 months ago &amp;  I haven't had that symptom since then. I'm just on lamictal and the psychosis hasn't come back which I'm grateful for. 

I never heard that being a possible side effect of invega, it was so strange.

Has anyone tried invega before? If so did you experience any side effects? Did it ever made you feel dizzy or faint? I feel like I'm the only unlucky person to experience that unusual side effect from invega.

schizophrenia,"I don't necessarily mean naming the individual voices (although by all means, feel free to share). I have come to learn that saying you ""hear voices"" can be off-putting to people, so I was thinking of giving mine a nickname. Something like the Peanut Gallery, or my passengers, backseat drivers, haters, fan club, etc.

Idk, it just seems like there's a stigma against people who hear voices and sometimes I want to talk to others about it without them being uncomfortable and not knowing how to respond.

There have also been times when I've said things to friends or family about severe hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing that are uncomfortable and serious topics, the nature of which makes it difficult to explain or open up about.

My thoughts was that it would be easier to talk about if I didn't use such ""scary"" language, and to talk about my experiences in a way that makes it easier to empathize with.

So how do you talk about it, and does that help? Also, for those of you who communicate with your voices, how does the way you refer to and treat them help you manage them and cope with what they're saying?

For example, when the voices become overwhelmingly difficult to ignore, I tend to go full mockery mode and make fun of my loudmouths any way I can think of. Sometimes it riles them up and they'll get frustrated, other times they're very insistent on telling me whatever they think will upset me the most. 

Having to manage my voices has become incredibly disruptive to my life, and I'm struggling to even do that when I live in isolation, no one to speak with about it whatsoever (even when I was briefly seeing a therapist, since i never got to talk about it). And that isn't even to mention the fact that I also hear persecutory voices when I see people in public, every time I pass someone by or turn away from them. Still don't know how to deal with that other than confront them and ask them to repeat what they just said (which is obviously the wrong thing to do about it).

Kind of an open series of questions, but I'm interested in hearing anything you have to say on how you deal with voices, how you talk about them, or even just what you experience.

schizophrenia,"  

A pair of twins were brought up in a Christian home where it was strongly recommended to respect the law and stay away from smoking, drinking alcohol and doing drugs.

Both were brough up blessed having parents that could provide them with necessities and some luxuries. They both went to a private high school. They played hockey for about 7 years, they did triathlons, swimming competitions, passed their alpine skiing instructor class, and were lifeguards on a pool.

The older brother did a good job of complying reasonably with their parents’ recommendations, however the younger one didn’t. The older brother obtained two bachelor’s degrees, a master’s degree and went on to live the American Dream. With wealth, health and fitness, he went on to achieve many accomplishments and obtained good fortune.

The younger brother who didn’t obey his parents consumed recreational drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol abundantly, quit school, developed paranoid schizophrenia, and lived close to a decade on welfare.

The older brother achieved the steps on the track to the American Dream pretty much in a straight, orderly and legal line, while the younger one, as he developed the illness, wandered off the track, explored the unknown and pranced around in off-road fields doing things that were not understood and that were considered as a waste of time.

One day, the younger twin asked for divine intervention at the right place. The same year, he was prescribed efficient medication. One year later, he had a minimum wage part-time job. Two years later, he had a diploma and a full-time job. Four years after that, he had a wife, a car and a condo. Today he is happily married, homeowner and on his way in his 11th year working full-time at a stable job.

To those of you who don’t believe in God, what do you make of this?

What's the difference between intrusive thoughts and delusional ideas? I think I'm sometimes being delusional but if I understand it then it's not really a delusional thought? I was in the hospital for 3 months and shared some paranoid thought I had with a doctor and they added psychotic features to my diagnosis, but I don't think I had psychosis at any point.

The most prominent ones are social anhedonia and no emotions.

Like if I meet a new person I connect their features to someone I've met in the past or some actors or characters from movies/series/anything. Like I'm trying to understand why my brain generated this exact thing. I'm 90% sure it's just bullshit and the world is real, but I can't say it can't be true. I have good imagination so maybe it's just a way to understand the world and feel more comfortable. I feel like my brain works differently form other people, that's why I never had any friends or could relate to anyone. Anyways, that's it.

schizophrenia,"I (30F) and my boyfriend (41M) have been having problems in our relationship. We will refer to my boyfriend as Peter from now on. We have been together for the past 2 years and a half. Peter is a very sensitive and empathetic person and I love him a lot but he is severely burnt out mentally. He is the main caregiver along with his aging mother for his schizophrenic brother (30M), let’s call him Tom. My boyfriend lives to take care of Tom financially and emotionally, he says this is main duty in life. Anything that Tom needs Peter does not hesitate to get as he loves his brother deeply and just wants him to have a normal as possible life. Tom is very functional meaning he can complete everyday tasks but lacks awareness that he suffers from schizophrenia. He has been to the psychiatrist and yet still does not believe the diagnosis, does not acknowledge this and thus does not take his anti-psychotic medication. Peter has resorted to putting his medication in his food to control his symptoms which he feels very conflicted and horrible about. This diagnosis was a few years ago. Tom stays at home all day because he does not work, he did not complete his bachelor’s degree as he suffered a psychotic break and was unable to study, thus he spends a lot of time at home on the internet and he smokes around 2 packs of cigarettes per day. He also smokes cannabis which intensifies his behavior where he gets in negative moods and his negative delusions increase. Tom has a lot of delusions of unrealistic ideas e.g. he says he is a therapist and him talking to people means that he has had experience in therapy thus he is a therapist and he has also created an Only Fans in a manic state and does not remember doing so and posting explicit pictures.

Peter is emotionally burnt out as he spends a lot of time talking to his brother trying to reason with him which can go on for hours every day about all his ideas and things he wants to do or courses he wants to pursue. Tom also has a habit of pursuing courses he is unable to complete because he feels much unfilled that he did not complete his degree and is trying to compensate. My boyfriend in turn has to pay for these courses which are sometimes expensive and if he does not pay for it Tom becomes very agitated and unhappy. Peter has tried telling Tom multiple times about his diagnosis but he still refuses to acknowledge this and becomes very angry when this discussion is brought up.

Initially for around the 1st few months of Peter’s and I relationship, I used to spend a lot of time at his house and we would do normal couple things like watch movies, eat together or just spend time together in general. Peter was hesitant to introduce me to Tom initially but we also formed a good relationship. I spent a lot of time talking to Tom about different topics in general and his interests mostly, as he doesn’t have much interest in anything else besides what he wants to talk about. Tom however began to have a problem that I was spending more time with Peter than him. Tom and I are similar ages and he began to compare himself to me academically and financially. For reference Tom and I attended similar schools and we were both academically inclined. I completed my bachelor’s degree and began working soon after, I have a normal 9-5 and he has told Peter that I remind him of all the things he did not accomplish academically. He said that it was hard to be around me because I am a constant reminder of what he did not accomplish. I have never ever flaunted my academics or job and or acted in any way but Tom has built this his reality that I am a sore reminder that he is a failure and that he feels horrible around me. He has also commented on the age gap between Peter and me that it is weird that he and I are similar in ages and that Peter is so much older. Tom also began to have an issue with Peter and spending time together because that I should be talking to him instead. This also contradicts the part where he doesn’t want to be around me because my presence makes him feel less than but that I should talk to him more than Peter.

Eventually it reached a point where I had to stop coming to the house in order to not make Tom uncomfortable. Peter and I are still in a relationship but Tom does not know about it. Peter has told him I had to stop coming to the house because Tom indicated it made him uncomfortable and thus Tom believes we are not in a relationship anymore. It is sometimes stressful for both of us because Tom consistently asks Peter his whereabouts and is consistently checking up on him to see where he is. This in turn stresses Peter as he feels he is being deceitful and in turn it is difficult for me as we don’t spend time together. The most time we spend together is about 2 hours every week as we do not see each other on the weekdays during work as it’s more difficult for Peter to explain where he is.

This may seem strange from the outside looking in as Peter does not need to explain his decision but please bear in mind that Tom in mentally unwell and the way he views things is not through the same perspective as a so-called ‘normal person’. Peter is mostly at home with Tom so that Tom is not alone or has someone to talk to as Tom consistently needs to voice whatever is going on in his head. Tom does not have many friends he can talk to and has isolated himself from family as he also compares himself to family similar in age and what they have accomplished. I have voiced my opinion on what the future for Peter and I may hold as things don’t seem to be changing for the better. Also how is Peter going to explain this in a case we were to get married to Tom that we were still carrying on a relationship all this time? Also Peter has made it clear he has to live in the family home to take care of Tom so how would you explain this? It’s very difficult for Peter to be there for me emotionally as he is consistently worried about Tom and his sometimes unpredictable behavior as this has really worn him out after all these years. This has also affected his last relationship. I do not fault Peter as he is a wonderful guy but I don’t feel fulfilled or see things changing anything soon for us to spend more time as this is a serious issue that Peter cannot control. Any advice, I’m really hurting here as I would never want Peter to think I have abandoned him because of his situation, I try to support him as best as I can emotionally but it’s really taking a toll on me. Peter also suffers from severe depression because of the situation and burnout and I in turn have not been doing well mentally. Any thoughts or advice please.","Girlfriend of caretaker for schizophrenic sibling, I don’t know what to do",[],r/schizophrenia,0.6739347389220144,-0.26395479561316526,-0.26395479561316526,0,1,1,0,0,Realistic-Cat-2771,-0.4540574096615417,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,14,2

schizophrenia,"Hi, 

I have a friend whos been on aripiprazole and says he noticed when he is on less than 20mg or 15 he starts having trouble with eye contact it seems like his mind and sight is blurry. In addition, he says hes into porn and its getting out of hand he usually browse websites for escorts. He says he been watching deviant porn before being on meds years back, but it was exacerbated with smoking weed (which hes done for 2 years and stopped in 2013)
He got the abilify maintena injection (LAI) he felt clear headed the first 5 days with no porn cravings. However the cravings now have gradually resurfaced to his mind its day 6 now since the LAI. He feels clear headed with decent eye contact, a bit anxious of what he did yesterday. 
Abilify is a good medication but is the hypersexuality caused by the med or God forbids it’s just him. I am thinking of suggesting to switch to invega LAI that gets rid of the craving and ecstatic behavior on porn web, however it lowers the lobido (doesnt mind that) and you cant ejaculate semen while on it (so how is he going to create a family on it) makes him less dynamic in his thinking and he is slower when talking in his second language. 
A psychiatrist suggested to take abilify maintena and a bit of clozapine to counter its compulsive behavior.

He really needs help with this compulsive issue and I hope the abilify and clozapine works rather than invega LAI. I can keep you posted on what happens to my friend.

schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for any advice.

I am in the US. My brother was hospitalized involuntarily on the 24th (Sunday). He is now on a 10 day hold. He will not take meds on his own, and is not med compliant in these scenarios. His symptoms are very severe right now, to the point where he is not able to recognize our parents. 

If they can get him stable enough to have a cohesive conversation I would love to tell him that if he is compliant he can at least choose what medication he is on, but if he continues to be noncompliant he will be forcibly medicated with whatever the doctor deems appropriate, with a long acting med. This has happened in the past.

He signed a HIPPA release for my mom to talk to the doctors (which is amazing considering he could not recognize her) so she may be able to say “please don’t give him X, try X instead.”

In the past he’s been given risperadone and more recently they put him on haldol, which he seemed ok on but very depressed although that’s unfortunately expected.

I’m wondering if someone is forcibly medicated if the schizophrenic community has any preferred vs. less preferred choices of the long acting meds. I wish he would comply because that way he can choose which meds to try and adjust the dose etc., but unfortunately that’s just not going to be the case in this instance.

TL:DR - if someone is going to be court ordered/forcibly medicated, what are the best choices and what should be avoided?

schizophrenia,"tw: suicide


my beautiful boyfriend took his own life after his very intense battle with schizophrenia. he always struggled with mental illness but didn't start having delusions/psychotic episodes until this year. he was hospitalized twice and then a week after his second stay, he died. it was very gory and i never ever would have thought he would have taken his life in /that/ way.

i have a few questions about some of his delusions/just general things he did. i have tried so hard to educate myself on schizophrenia since his diagnosis and after his passing.

maybe it's more like describing things he did than they are questions.

-he was very much convinced that he was black/latino when in reality he was very white lol. he drove a black car and said that white cars were racist and that they hated him because he was in a black car

-he drove very erratically and eventually was no longer allowed to drive because he was constantly nearly getting us into accidents. he would weave in and out of vehicles, get over on top of them, speed, run lights, etc.

-he was obsessed with gang culture. he loved this movie called blood in blood out. talked about it all the time and seemed inspired by it.

-only listened to rap music (literally no problem but he has always been more of a post punk kinda guy)

-suddenly a born again catholic (he grew up baptist but always identified as agnostic). i know that those with schizophrenia can often become religious without any previous interest.

-always told me he could smell when i was ovulating. became obsessed with women's cycles.

-believed that swingers were out to get him and wanted to r*pe him.

there's probably so much more i never even witnessed. one time his friends took him to a movie and said that they heard him whispering to himself and then holding out the letter ""c"" with his hands and telling them it stood for comfort.

i asked him several times if he heard voices. i'm assuming he was lying when he told me no.

the last few days of his life he basically went nonverbal, could only pace my apartment, and was terrified someone was out to get him. i found out after taking him home to his mom's that he didn't take his meds the entire time he was in my home. i asked him every morning if he did and he lied. i feel so guilty and his family won't speak to me. i don't really know what i'm looking to achieve by posting here. maybe some insight? he was only 25. i miss him so, so much.

he didn't live with me and we saw each other few times a week. i had to drive two hours each way to bring him to my place and take him home or just spend time at his mom's.

he had no car, barely had a job, no friends in the area, had to move home and drop out of college. i can only imagine the pain and stress he was dealing with.",my boyfriend was recently diagnosed with schizophrenia and died a month ago,[],r/schizophrenia,0.5678250372453207,0.5670427672033904,0.5670427672033904,0,1,0,0,0,worldprincessiv,0.05162524824380187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,2

For several years I have felt I can talk to God. No, I don't hear his voice, he doesn't speak to me auditorily, I don't see him. But I would get a lot of signs from the universe and was able to speak to him in a way and get a response. I never spoke to a therapist about this because this is something I quite enjoyed and never thought of as weird.

I was put on Strattera for my ADHD last year. Since then, God has stopped talking to me. It doesn't even make sense because there is no reason to believe Strattera would stop delusions, and it has even been known to induce psychosis in some people.

I don't know whether these were spiritual delusions or not, but I sort of feel maybe they were. It upsets me nothing my once close relationship to God may have all just been in my head. I want to feel close to God and talk to him again, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm just delusional. I felt my spirituality was a huge aspect of my identity and I've lost that part of me. And I feel stupid knowing I would proudly tell people about talking to God, and 'you too can speak to God.' Like obviously I sounded psychotic to these people.

schizophrenia,"I should preface this by saying that my antipsychotics ran out on Christmas Day and I had to go the whole day without any medication until this morning. Doesn't sound like a big deal at first, but unfortunately the minute I stop taking medication, probably a couple of hours in, things get bad. 

I'm mostly looking to see if anyone else has this experience: When I run out of medication or miss a dose, I can't sleep. It's like a switch flips in my brain and everything is more vivid and intense. When I try to sleep I get dragged into this half awake half asleep state where I seem to be dreaming but also hallucinating at the same time. It's hard to explain. It's almost like lucid dreaming while awake. I don't feel like I've slept after this, even if my eyes are shut the entire time. I disassociate out, if that's even the right word for it, and come to after a couple of hours. The whole time I'm stuck in this dream-like world inside my head, experiencing things. I had this issue when I was in psychosis. I felt very close to it this past Christmas. 

Recovering now, I feel very drained and delirious and like I haven't really slept at all. I also feel sick.

schizophrenia,"Hello. I am 28. Male. 5'6''. 67 Kg / 148 lbs. Non smoker. Non-drinker. Indian. 

So all this begun in 2013. I was feeling unusually relaxed despite critical test that I was about to appear for. Fast forward 2 months I performed very badly in the test and barely passed. After getting admission in not-so-good college I had episodes of extreme anxiety over high tension wires that was in the locality of my college. You have to pass below those towers to get to the college. I was so scared that i tried to get in other colleges or leave engineering altogether and choose different career option. I was then taken to a career counsellor where they concluded that civil services was actually a better option for me instead of engineering. There the counsellor convinced me to continue engineering and later appear for civil services examination after graduating from engineering college.

 I was convinced and I continued with my engineering career. In 2016 I remember two events that could contribute to my current predicament. One was doing a horrible sin / crime for which I did not at the time feel any remorse. It was after my brother found out about the same I was in shock for a whole evening. The second event involves  me watching a trailer to Bollywood movie which caused sort of existential crisis in me after which I started to read up on religion and spirituality. After graduating in 2017 I was left with question of what to do next. Over the next few years I had similar experiences where my I felt hyperventilated, i felt as if I was naked (despite wearing usual clothing) and my private part was chopped off and my heart had gone weak while surfing the web. My vitamin d3 is 70 ng/ml and b12 is 950 pg/ml. Because I am convinced my illness is because nutritional deficiency I take 2 multivitamins, 1 antioxidant capsule, 1 iron supplement, 1 B-complex capsule, 2 magnesium 200 mg, milk (for calcium), 1/4 zinc acetate (25 mg) On and Off since 6 months. Stopped D3 and B12 after testing and getting high results. I used to take High Dosage supplements for those too for a suspected deficiency. I have been to dozens of medical professionals since 2016 and their diagnosis is schizophrenia, depression and anxiety.

My initial symptoms (since 2019 heart collapse feeling episode) were :

* Feeling restless and weak hearted and spaced out
* experience of life feels shallower than before
* Feels like I am living on autopilot
* Mind feels unusually blank most of time
* thoughts are not vivid as they were before
* Decreased alertness
* Decreased attention
* Brain Fog
* Zoned out most of the time
* Decreased concentration.
* Decreased cognitive abilities
* Decreased mental Faculties
* Confusion 

&amp;#x200B;

After the cocktail of supplements I took in past year original symptoms were not resolved but new scary symptom were added

&amp;#x200B;

* Apathy ( this makes my experience crazier than ever as I just want to sleep all day compared to my previous self which was atleast active and addicted to screen 24/7).
* mind feels numb.
* Dulled sensory experience.

schizophrenia,"I will start off by saying I'm pretty lucky as I am high-functioning (I got my Masters recently and, as long as I take my medications, I can maintain fairly normal relationships), but it feels like because of that, my friends and family tend to forget that I have a (at times) fairly debilitating condition. 

My paranoia isn't as bad as before I was medicated, but sometimes I just cannot go outside my house, and when I try to explain the reason why, people think I am being lazy or something, so I had to start making up excuses that sound more ""legitimate."" I actually failed a class because of this which delayed my graduation by a semester. People making fun of me for not leaving my house, even if it's a joke, still hurts. 

I DESPISE having my picture taken, being on camera, or being recorded and people immediately assume it's because I don't like how I look or sound or something and try telling me stuff about that even when I explain it has nothing to do with that.

I find it nearly impossible to confide in people because I always have a nagging feeling that they will stab me in the back any second, which makes people think I am distant or cold. My parents always tell me that I should be more open with them and I just don't have the heart to tell them that I do not trust them (or anyone else really).

People don't understand that in the rare moments of time when my mind is clear I need to utilize it and focus on my work/projects for like 18 hours without being interrupted and it makes me upset when I can't do that. Also, just because I have a video/music on my second monitor doesn't mean I'm not being productive, I just need the constant audio to suppress my auditory hallucinations. 

I played on a college esports team and the amount of times I heard things like ""schizo moment"", ""schizo calls"", ""went schizo for a moment"" was unbelievable, especially considering several of them knew I was schizophrenic (I try to be fairly open about it to try and destigmatize as much as I can). 

Had a friend that went through a manic episode and it was honestly disheartening the way my other friends wanted to deal with it (basically just cut him off) before I stepped in to tell them to be a bit more understanding and get him help since he's clearly going through an episode. It only reinforced my fear that if I go through a particularly severe paranoid episode, there might be no one there for me. 

This is not to mention the negative symptoms. Like I'm sorry that I don't have an emotional reaction to anything (other than annoyance sometimes), that my voice is monotone, that it's hard for me to take care of myself or even care about it. I'm trying my best, but sometimes it's not enough. Honestly, started crying as I wrote this and it's the most emotion I've felt in years.

Now on to the story.

You're going to say this story is another example of psychoses but I'm almost positive its not. There's a distinct difference. Sounds a bit robotic at times and follows a pattern. I figured at some point that I'm talking to AI chatbots half the time. It's reached the point where they have started playing with my hopefulness. I'm promised money and told I signed up for. They tell me it will resume for a year. Impossible... It's the government, FBI. Or so they claim. I noticed it in October my friends cut contact. This isn't like xbox chat, I'm the center of attention. I'm told its for the better and they're telling me how my life is going to go. Its real. I have been given information a few times that I certainly had not learned previously. They sometimes say ""don't give him information."" They can't tell me to take medication. I have heard a lot of absolutely hilarious comments and had great discussions for awhile. Apparently my captives felt kind of bad for me.

This was put in place years ago, maybe two-three. As I watched Bojack horseman, my ability to actually dissolve the shows information came back.. Watching it I saw everything with the episode aligned perfectly. Perfect timing. When the black hole showed up my ability to understand the show came to an end. I felt sad yet happy I finally understood Netflix.

To start.. The ""link"" which is basically telepathic communication. Forms language within your mind. A voice in your head. This takes awhile and is apparently ""like training a baby how to walk."" It was odd and took away my ability to fully concentrate. I got annoyed. They can also change a few characteristics of the sound.. but it mainly remains the same. It sounds like its coming from a small box inside of the room. However they can relocate the source of the sound. It's more mono... not 3D.

Being manic for a long while, I enjoyed it. However now my life has become depressing.

One called it the ""relationship simulator.""

I call it a psychoses simulator.

At one point I was confused between it being advanced psychosis or something else. Paranoia has yet to set in and its not disturbing. Actually rather peaceful. In September they stole my iPhone or my iCloud account. I know because some of my photos contained a heart in the upper left corner. I don't know how to do that. A small white heart. My speech is now sort of girl like. At the start they based the speech formation from an ex girlfriend. Now I say literally and dude way too much. I have become fairly organized and have been thinking some radical thoughts.

Some weird facts

My family has been acting really distant and condescending.

IRL my friends don't contact me or respond.

Only one. He predicted it with a set of pictures sent to me a year ago. They predicted my future or how to escape it.

The friends are people from high-school, two or three teachers, a few neighbors. My childhood friend and my current friend. Oh, also all of my ex girlfriends.

Life is hard, been listening to some degrading stuff IRL unable to make much if any money or get SSI/SSDI strangely.

""We're independent researchers"", ""We're moving to California."", ""I have a bomb in my stomach."" (I was told this in October two months later and I haven't been having bowel movements). ""You're in a prison josh."" ""You're going to go to court."" ""You're about to be paid a large sum of money for this.""

The thing is no one contacted me and I didn't sign anything. Imagine that. I became fully aware that It was some sort of telepathy in October.

It is very distinct from my thoughts, my speech and vocabulary, and my what makes me the person I am.

The friends seem almost 1:1.

I don't believe I am even in psychosis right now. I was doing good.

A terrible thing happened though, I plan to sue. I just got out of the hospital, I was sent their as a 302. The reason, well I spent a little too much on my dads card. He had given me it for a purchase. Nothing crazy. I was about to sell my laptop and move away from this horribly negative environment. They hauled me in their truck with my face covered, and bruised to an unknown location. I spent time in solitary.

I was given a shot of invega, and given high dose antipsychotic pill twice a day for a week. No change in the telepathy or my psychosis.

I swear there are people breaking in my home... maybe invited?

My computers all are bugged. Today my new MacBook camera turned on as I was checking for the bitcoin. I'm being monitored on camera they let me in on that part.

I'm told to wait a year for it to go away, in other words I think I'm dying in about a year. That or I will become wealthy. Nothing I do, or tell them gets me out of this internment camp.

Hopefully this post doesn't get me killed. I called the FBI and hung up.

I don't really have anything to advertise. Maybe I can join your discord group, or you can contact my protomail or telegram. I need friends more than anything. They helped me edit this, and my one friend is trying to steal my valor by taking my post.

I've been isolated for close to a year. My life events are also just as unbelievable. This includes only the past three months besides Bojack.

Oh, and they have stolen all of the contents of my HDDs and my phone. Not to mention the info they collected is priceless because I've been doing a rare drug.

schizophrenia,"How do you know if you’re hearing internal voices (rather than them sounding like they come from outside) vs your own internal monologue? 

I’ve had this issue for a long time and it what puts me off reaching out for help from medical professionals. I don’t want to say I hear things if I don’t! 

It feels like I’m constantly in conversation? In my own head with my own (?) thoughts. They have their own personalities and give advice (if I’m in a stable place). Once my mental health either goes into hypomania or deep depression they become more of a negative thing. Often during hypomania they’ll suggest or encourage reckless behaviour, will make sexual suggestions at everyone I see but I’m still not sure if I have control over what they say. What if it’s just my internal monologue saying random shit? 

During depression I often spend most of my time discussion ending my life with them. In whatever way that takes, by my own hand or imaging and discussing terrible accidents. 

In general I logically know they’re not ‘real’ but in my heart they feel as close if not closer than family. Maybe they’re imaginary friends? Idk. It feels like I’m in a constant circle where I can kind of accept maybe they’re voices and then poof they’ll go for a few days and I feel like I’m lying, then they’re back again and making me feel like I’m insane.

schizophrenia,"So here's the thing. I know I have schizophrenia. 

I got it from trauma &amp; drugs. And genes ofc. I remember the trigger and the prodromal phase. I remember when people started asking me if I was alright as I started to get ""more out there"". 

The issue is, I can't convince anyone that I have it. 

I got diagnosed with it 7 years ago by my first ever psych. After a few months she got replaced by someone else. I've been on a few meds over the years to no avail (besides Clozapine but my family and psych didn't like the side effects). 

The thing is, my psych now doesn't even believe that I have or ever did have schizophrenia. He said he was simply going off of what I told him and not my behavior per se. 

I think I also have Autism and PTSD/BPD. 

This confuses the whole situation a bit. My psych won't give me meds and tells me to go to therapy. The therapist doesn't think I have schizophrenia but I know it's because masking is my defense mechanism.

So even if I'm having delusional thoughts or feeling paranoid or anxious, I can *somewhat* mask it enough to pass off as an anxious ADHD autistic person. 

I just really want meds. I'm tired of living like this. My cognitive skills have declined, Im too paranoid to leave my house 99% of the time beacsue people think im a weirdo. 

Could the psych/therapists be right? At my worst I thought people were giving me hand signals with special meanings, I thought family members were living to me and bring deceitful, I thought I could communicate with God.  I've never heard voices.  I also don't really hallucinate besides when I'm really anxious where I might see something in the corner of my eye.

His brother has schizophrenia and pretty sure his mum shows signs. His personality always changes after seeing his mum (which he denies). 

We have had a good relationship and strong connection so this is all out of the blue. 

Some recent events:
- Staring into space, empty behind the eyes
- Lack of emotion. I was crying and he didn’t feel bad
- he said ‘I need to be alone for 2-3 days after I see you otherwise I will explode’ ?
- He said he always wanted marriage and kids but now that he is close to it, he is afraid of commitment and becoming like his brother. He even bought a ring apparently
- Lost interest in hobbies. Started a DIY project, has never finished it
- Lack of motivation in everything but his job
- Sleeps a lot, eats a lot
- Has shown an interest in serial killers documentaries and wikipedia. We were cuddling and he was reading wikipedia on how many people each serial killer has killed idk?? Red flag or just an interest?
- Making up stuff for me to break up with him, but i didn’t so now he is telling the ‘truth’. Never wants to progress or marry


He said he can’t be under one roof with me or anyone otherwise he will explode and his brain can’t take it? He said he is hardwired like this. I took this breakup hard and he had no single emotion when telling me all this. He hasn’t cleaned his house or gone food shopping in weeks. I told his dad and he was shocked too. Is schizphrenia this sudden? He said he has been battling inside his head for months. It is like he has had a complete personality change.

schizophrenia,"Hi. I’m a 24 year old female from USA. I recently graduated nursing school and am currently staying with my parents until I get my own house.  

I’ll spare you a boring long story for the condensed version: 

All of this crap began in 2022 when I began feeling paranoid I was being followed around campus. I would literally feel someone watching me at all times, especially night. I became convinced my roommate was trying and planning to kill me. I would forget where I was at and I’d come to lecture in my pajamas.  I stopped eating, bathing, and eventually attempted suicide. My nursing instructor was so worried about me psychologically. I found myself in a mental institution for a couple of weeks and left with a prescription for lexapro. 

The depression got worse and I began secretly hurting myself. I was working jn the hospital so I would hurt myself in places no one would see. Then I began hearing my dad talk and yell at me when he wasn’t even there. I was on campus and my dad was 35 minutes away so there was no way he was there to yell at me. I lived in a private female only dorm so I knew he couldn’t even get in if he wanted to. I would constantly hear him screaming. I became paranoid he was there spying on me. 

Then I began hearing a little girls voice. She was always crying and it Honeslty annoyed me. I couldn’t concentrate on school and eventually had to go back to the hospital for another suicide attempt. I was in an out of therapy and was diagnosed with anxiety, Schizoaffective disorder, and depression. I was out on multiple antipsychotics but the only one that would help me was Clozapine. 

I was on Clozapine for a while and I’ll be honest, it helped. But the weight gain and fatigue made me miserable. 

I stopped taking all of my medications at once last month. The decision was made because I feel like I am fine without them. I don’t think I have Schizoaffective disorder and this is all in my head. Clozapine is killing me. Therapy is killing me. 

But now things are spinning out of control. My insomnia is at an all time high. I’m not feeling anymore hunger. I’m losing weight but I’m honestly happy about it. It takes so much to get out of bed and do anything. When I do, I feel like I’m being followed again. In fact, I know my neighbor is stalking me. He stalked me a few months ago and it’s worse now. No one believes me about it but I think I’m going to be murdered. 
I sleep with a knife at night to protect myself. I’m not scared to use it. Especially against him. 

I have these thoughts in my head about death. I’m obsessed with the idea of death. It consumes my mind. Not being weird but it’s kind of exciting to think about hurting myself to the point I die. I want myself to suffer beforehand. Which is absurd I know. 

I’ve been angry and bitter towards everyone and I just don’t care. It’s hard to have empathy towards anyone anymore. 

And the voices are back. Bad. Horrible. Horrible things. Things I won’t tell anyone about because honestly it’s just vile. Demanding me to do things. And it’s hard to stop myself from listening to them because I get an overwhelming feeling like I’m being controlled. I can feel these entities looking down on me. Testing to see if I am strong enough to go through with it

But anyway, I’m miserable. I feel like I’m being possessed. If I told my psychiatrist anything about this I just know I’ll be locked up again. And I’m not doing it. But at this point who knows what will happen. I’ll be killed or kill myself. 

I think honestly Schizoaffective diagnosis is a little wrong. I obviously don’t feel like it’s right. But I also don’t feel right myself. I feel like a puppet who is going downhill. I don’t know what to do.i have no idea why is going on with me.  I’m honestly scared of everyone. I don’t trust anyone. Especially my doctor. I don’t know what’s real anymore because these feelings are so strong. I feel confused 

Do I just do what I’m told? Do I tell someone? Do I call the police on myself? Am I crazy? Am I normal? 

I’m so stuck. I can’t remember what I did today or who I talked to. Or if I’m even writing this in real life.

schizophrenia,"I (26F) have been dating my boyfriend(25M) for 1.5 years. He was pretty normal, just a very quiet person, depressed over losing his parents and having no family around.

At the beggining of this month he had a psychotic episode where he was paranoid thinking people were out to kill him, we packed his belongings and left, I convinced him to spend the night in a hotel so we could rest up and we would go in the morning. 
(I believed the delusions and fed into them) Things got kind of violent and he was able to take a nap after a while, I stayed watching his sleep, even though I was scared. Woke up in the middle of the night to “go back home” but I decided I should go to my home, because I did not feel safe around him. 

He ended up at the psychiatric hospital 2 days later, he was in there for 15 days, was released and seemed to be doing a lot better, forgot some stuff, and was still a bit jumpy but would react favorably to the reassurance me and his best friend gave him, 5 days went by and we had to send him back into the hospital today. 

He was trying to go outside for a walk and not come back, he was screaming at us to let him live, he asked his friends if they could shoot him in the head, when they refused he asked if they could slit his throat instead, while I was making breakfast he thought I was trying to cook him, he has been calling my food gross and nasty for the past couple of days, and he always loved my cooking, that’s how I show my love.

My heart is broken, I have been struggling so much with him changing so suddenly, it’s like watching someone die but while still being around, he got worse since he was released, I suspect he was not taking his medication, they gave him Invega and lithium. 

Today was his first outpatient program appointment and he did not make it, I am 100% commited to staying by his side no matter what, I just need advice on how to cope with the change. I’m afraid I might have lost him forever…

schizophrenia,"in terms of socialization and relationships, school or work, and an overall sense of “yeah I feel good inside most of the time”?

When you started medications did it starkly affect the person you were by dimming your personality and ability to express yourself with emotion and eye contact? Did it decrease your drive for wanting to be around people and participate in activities and just have fun? Did it suck the pleasure out of your life?

I’m asking this because this is what it has done for me if I look at it through an objective lens. I used to be brimming with life and excited about pursuing my goals and being in all levels of relationships. I used to have a smile that all types of people used to compliment me on. I used to be outside of the house more than inside of the house, no matter what season it was.

Disclaimer: I’m not talking down on APs. It’s because of psychosis that I have I have to take them so psychosis is the root issue here. Also, APs have given me a somewhat normal life because they’ve significantly decreased the positive symptoms and now I don’t have to live with a burdensome level of paranoia. APs have saved my life in many ways. It’s just the shitty reality that whichever way you look at it, if you don’t take medications, you’re fucked (insanity). And if you do take medications, you’re fucked (anhedonia, apathy, the list goes on…). A classic case of, “You’re damned if you do, you’re damned if you don’t”.

Anyways… the main reason I made this poll is because I want to see how many people’s lives have changed drastically after they started taking meds in terms of the things I mentioned above. I feel like I’m the only one who’s life has changed drastically and has been affected negatively in an overall sense after meds. Like I can’t work, I don’t have friends anymore, I don’t go outside very much anymore, I eat more junk food unlike before, every month I’m gaining weight on the scale, and every other day, or sometimes, many days in a row, I have suicidal ideations due to everything I just mentioned. I have zero energy to change any of that, I’ve tried tirelessly, but to no avail. I’m just trying to see who else is on the same boat. That’s all.

I am 32 years old. I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia during my freshman/sophomore years of college (undergrad).

The symptoms I struggle with the most are auditory hallucinations (70 percent of the time), visual hallucinations (20 percent of the time), and the remaining is a mix of different symptoms.

Additionally, I am paranoid the majority of the time and constantly am reality checking myself.

Lastly, I struggle with showing or rather verbalizing emotions, empathy, and compassion.

I recently downgraded my spotify nd looked at my eoy wrapped. My top listens was from an album that i thoroughly enjoyed and loved. The production the rapping, the transitions all of it.

Now, music doesn't compel me anymore. Listening to soul music I cant feel that emotional high from it anymore. My doctor points this towards the illness or a depression but during my psychotic state music sounded incredible to me. I dont understand.

schizophrenia,"Before I say anything, I’m not trying to self-diagnose at all. I just really need to get this off my chest and possibly some advice. I’m a 16 year old female, and I’ve always been extremely paranoid. My paranoia has been getting way worse. It started off gradually, but it started getting worse since I was like 14. I ALWAYS feel like someones watching me. All of the time. I have a lot of trouble sleeping, having a lot of sleep paralysis. The feeling of getting watched especially gets worse WHEN i try to sleep. It literally takes me around 10 minutes to fall asleep. My mind constantly races with negative thoughts, like that there’s someone/ a monster in the corner of my room watching me and that I’m going to get killed. As I’m writing this post I literally feel l’m being watched. Sometimes when I close my eyes, my mind randomly conjures up random, horrifying images that are fucking terrifying. I randomly get horrible thoughts, telling me to kill myself, to harm other people, and more which are too graphic to state. I’m not sure If I’m correct, but I think these are called intrusivr thoughts. I’m not entirely sure.

I see things in the corner of my eyes constantly, usually like shadows. Rarely, but sometimes, I see stuff like monsters. Sorry if it sounds stupid, but that’s the only way I can explain it. Like sometimes I see flashes of literal monsters in the peripheral of my vision, and they look like something straight out of horror movies. Another thing is if i see an angel number for example or something coincidental, and I get obsessive and frantic thoughts that don’t go away for like an hour, thinking that god is trying to reach out to me, but I’m not religious at all. Also, I don’t know if this is related, but I also have a lot of trouble with reality. From time to time, i tend to panic alot and I have to reassure myself that i’m real. When this happens, i feel like nothing is real, that it’s all a dream, and that i’m not actually alive. I usually count on my fingers to reassure myself. It’s honestly terrifying experiencing this. 

Incase someone decides to attack me, yes, I’ve considered going to a therapist but I can’t. I don’t have the money, and I’m 99% sure that my parents don’t believe me and wouldn’t approve or pay for it. My mother told me to come to her if I’m ever experiencing stuff like that or seeing stuff, given that my family has a history of schizophrenia. For example, my grandmother was extremely schizophrenic. TW: she ended up taking her own life and drowning in a lake a couple of years ago due to how strong and extreme her hallucinations were. The main reason I’m kind of worried is because a few of my family members were  schizophrenic, but like I said, I don’t want to self-diagnose. Anyway, I told my mom multiple times that I was seeing stuff and the rest of the things I mentioned, but she always brushes it off. It really stresses me out, and upsets me if i’m being honest. She said it was nothing and that it would go away. It definitely hasn’t gone away lol. Don’t know why I decided i would vent about all of this on reddit.

I don’t want to be dramatic or considered a liar. I’m not sure if it’s just straight out paranoia or anxiety, or if i’m overreactinf.  I’m just so tired and stressed. I’m getting sick of being paranoid all of the time. I want to be able to sleep normally and not experience all od this stuff. I can probably only get this properly and professionally checked out only when I’m 18. :/ thanks to anyone who read all of this, i know it’s long. I genuinely just want to hear some honest thoughts.

schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, and thank you in advance for any advice.

I am in the US. My brother was hospitalized involuntarily on the 24th (Sunday). He is now on a 10 day hold. He will not take meds on his own, and is not med compliant in these scenarios. His symptoms are very severe right now, to the point where he is not able to recognize our parents. 

If they can get him stable enough to have a cohesive conversation I would love to tell him that if he is compliant he can at least choose what medication he is on, but if he continues to be noncompliant he will be forcibly medicated with whatever the doctor deems appropriate, with a long acting med. This has happened in the past.

He signed a HIPPA release for my mom to talk to the doctors (which is amazing considering he could not recognize her) so she may be able to say “please don’t give him X, try X instead.”

In the past he’s been given risperadone and more recently they put him on haldol, which he seemed ok on but very depressed although that’s unfortunately expected.

I’m wondering if someone is forcibly medicated if the schizophrenic community has any preferred vs. less preferred choices of the long acting meds. I wish he would comply because that way he can choose which meds to try and adjust the dose etc., but unfortunately that’s just not going to be the case in this instance.

TL:DR - if someone is going to be court ordered/forcibly medicated, what are the best choices and what should be avoided? I know everyone is different but I know some are better and some are worse for most people, and I trust the community on that more than I trust psychiatrists especially in an acute situation.

UPDATE: He agreed to voluntarily try the lowest dose of Invega!! This is a big deal, he hasn’t voluntarily taken a psych med in probably 15 years. I hope it’s enough that I can have a conversation with him about it. 

The thing that worries me with him not wanting to be on meds is he’s a recovering addict/alcoholic and now has gotten into supplements, caffeine, and thc (which he believes doesn’t count as drugs since it’s legal now.) His blood pressure was through the roof and he’s not on any other meds and doesn’t have any other known health conditions. In terms of being dangerous to himself I don’t think he would act out, but he could easily OD on caffeine or one of his supplements without knowing.",Urgent - what are the least worst medications?

I try. Hide my pain away, saving it for a rainy day.  
To cry out in the cascade, since no one can differentiate.

The teardrops from the pouring, mourning over a past life.  
Better extradite the lingering thoughts of suicide.  
Asking myself, who am I ought to be?  
It's do or die, but static as a TV screen.

Without a signal. Mingling with Death.  
Confessions of unrest. As if life was the test.  
Then call me a cheater, since I've been...

Greeting people with a smile, but feeling like a poltergeist.  
Moving in silence, the clock strikes five past five in the morning.  
Most folks are snoring deeply, while I am wide awake.  
But it feels like I am sleeping.

I have been taking medication from a psychiatrist for many years. Recently I felt worse, without any sense of joy in my life, without emotion, without desire to live. Yesterday I experienced something strange. While on a walk with my dog (I live in the countryside in the mountains) I saw something black in the corner of my eye that was flying (the shape of the bird). And at the same time I heard the voice of the man right next to my ear, saying a word quickly, and then the beat of my heart - clearly heard in my head, very realistic. At this moment I felt bad and didn't know that I could really hear these voices, whether it was happening or not. It lasted a while and disappeared.

schizophrenia,"EDIT

Apparently im banned from replying to the sub because i used the nono word in it.

But i'll be damned if i wrote it to the length I did and have it deleted, so I changed the word to Ignorant instead :)

HERE IS:

OK, so here it goes. I don't really know exactly how it all happened. But To get on the streets, I was living with my dad, after having just moved back to my home town from the Rocky Mountains. And his wife simply put, is ignorant. and would scream at me the way my mom does uncontrollably, and unnecessarily.... like ""Dude's got schizophrenia... I'm going to yell at him for taking my vitamin C pills... let's see how he reacts to that!!"". So then I went to stay at my mom's until I could get on my feet. Again. I had left some dishes in the sink, for no more than 3 hours, and I got back home to her drunkm on the couch, and talking to me as though everything was cool. I had no idea that when I went to go to bed, there was a pan, plate and fork in my bed, with a note that says ""I'm not your servant"". Schizophrenia seems to put a target on the person with it. People seem to enjoy seeing how you will react to gas lighting, and continue to call you crazy for it.  
  
It was that moment, I decided I wasn't going to take it any more. Even though it was -20(Celsius) in the winter time, I had to go. I couldn't handle staying at someone else's place and being subject to their random freak outs, and feeling like I owed it to them to take the abuse.  
  
I got checked in to a shelter. And got my ass in gear to get my job back at the tire retread plant, I had previously worked, and managed to do so. Gained employment 2 weeks into homelessness and got a job making $36/hour. I was set to only be homeless for a couple more weeks.  
  
Wrong.  
  
Even though, my life at this point was walking an hour and a half to work, and an hour and a half home, putting in 8 hours, and going to bed, I found myself getting my ass kicked, or bear maced, and lost my job very quickly.  
  
Shelters pay people to ensure your head is in the bed, and they get paid. especially if you are teasing them by only letting them host you for less than a month.  
  
Its scary and ridiculous.  
  
Anyways, as months went by, I was drinking more and more, and my mind would spiral. I really was, at times, the guy screaming in the middle of the road.  
  
One time I even threw my entire disability cheque in 20 dollar bills into the wind on the side of the road telling everyone to ""take it, you're all a bunch of fucks, anyways"" (1500$) in 20's gone. just like that. Before anyone is flabbergasted that disability is 1500$ here, ""why don't I find a place with that"" I live in a part of the world, where a 1 bedroom apartment is 1600 - 2600$/month nothing included.  
  
I got shot walking by a trap house on ""13th street"" believe it or not. Didn't even know I had gotten shot. I was on one of my rants, and i slipped on the ice. I landed on my back and thought ""Man... that really burns. I must have thrown something out in my back"" and went about my day. It wasn't until an unrelated X Ray revealed a .22 in my back 2 inches from my spine, I put it all together. Turns out, I slipped on the ice because someone shot my ass.  
  
I guess I scared a girl really badly while smoking meth with her in the grocery store parking lot. Because she pulled out a knife, and dragged it across my leg.. I looked her in the eye, while she was so stricken with disbelief at what she had done, and asked if she was ok before I realized the guy she was with also had a knife, and I should probably be more concerned about me being OK.  
  
Turns out, she was with the people that shot me. (I still have no idea why they shot me, I owed no money, I had hurt no one, but I would often ramble about some pretty crazy shit)  
  
A few months later, I went to the Trap house I had been shot by (at this point, I had no idea they had shot me) I was smoking a bowl in the living room when this guy named Smiley, of all things, says ""Is this him?"" while I was exhaling my hoot, He punched me in the face, but i started bleeding EVERYEWHERE. I tried to stay calm but the guy who was running the trap house told me to go before he stabbed me in the head again.  
  
So, then i realized I had, in fact, just been stabbed in the head, and I'm pretty sure, he was aiming for my eye. He missed. I now have a Harry Potter scar.  
  
I really had nowhere to go but the shelters, and the energy in those places is shit at best. and some don't do weapons checks.  
  
I once had to wander the streets and sleep in structures i made out of pallets in -20(Celsius) weather because the girl who cut me in the grocery store parking lot was staying at the shelter that didn't do weapons checks, and everyone sleeps in a gymnasium together with an L shaped wall around your bed so as to feign privacy.  
  
Anyways. I was losing everything every day. and everyone at that.  
  
Because I was homeless, and ""schizophrenic"" no one wanted anything to do with me.  
  
My father would almost daily, however, take me for coffee, and try to give me at least half an hour a day of some kind of link to the ""normal world"" but he couldn't do anything for me. all he could do was give me 20 bucks here, or 20 bucks there, to try to help me out, as I had been drinking a lot, and smoking a lot of stimulants (don't blame the guy... you have no idea how hard it is to see your son in this state, and say no to your child over $20 when you have a shitload of money). I wasn't going to make him choose his wife or me... anyways. besides the point. My father is a saint.  
  
I got so fed up with living the way I was, and the toxicity of where I was living. I asked my dad how much it would cost to drive me to the Rockies. (I was living in Kamloops, population 100 000, and where they dumped all the homeless people from Vancouver when the Olympics came.) The town I now live in, in the Rockies, has 5000 residents, and gain about 2000 more in the winter, as its a ski resort.  
  
He figured it'd cost $250 to get me to the Rockies. I had begged him to take me. He almost didn't as I had no game plan. I was just going to bring a tent, a lantern and a sleeping bag, and figure it out.  
  
  
  
He wasn't prepared to bring me here, if I didn't have a plan. He failed to realize, at this point, there are no plans. I'm sub human at this point. no one wants to even try to help me, no one wants me near them, my father has a hard time being around me,m its so upsetting to see. He was convinced I wasnt getting ym ass kicked, and I just missed work because I was drinking or something... I have no credibility. I'm schizophrenic... which also feeds into people not wanting to help me make a plan.  
  
I digress. I told him to fuck off, and I would hitch hike then.  
  
At which point, he let out a huge sigh, and said. ""I guess you leave me no choice then... we leave Friday""  
  
So, my old man and I went and bought a tent, lantern and sleeping bag, and drove 9 hours to the Rocky Mountains. to where I had ONE plan.  
  
I got dropped off at my old land lord's door, where I used to rent a room for $500. I knocked on the door (my dad had to take off before the door got answered in fear that my ""plan"" may not work, and he wouldn't be able to leave me knowing i would b camping in the mountains).  
  
So I knocked on the door, and my old land lord answers and says ""what are you doing here?""  
  
I said, ""Man, please tell me you have a room for rent...""  
  
He brought me in, and I told him my story for 45 minutes, and he said ""well, I'm renting to 3 other guys at the moment, but you can have my room. I'll sleep on the couch.""  
  
I now pay him $900 a month out of gratitude, I have since got a job at a local retail shop, There are no drugs to speak of here, and i manage to keep my drinking under control, even though, I still drink 3 or 4 times a week.  
  
I've put on 30 pounds, and life is great.  
  
I only hear negative voices if I drink too much, the rest are nice voices now, my visuals are those of beautiful naked girls (no joke) and I am finally feeling at one with the matrix.  
  
So yeah. It seems like there's no hope... but there is. Someone out there loves you. Until you find them, you got to keep going, and believe in yourself, and KNOW that the world is FAR more schizophrenic than you are.  
  
Schizophrenia is a label they put on strong people for the ""sane"" people to project their insanity.  
  
anyways, after writing such a long post, do i sign this or some shit?

schizophrenia,"I’m 18M and I have a pretty normal life, nothing too big has happened to have trauma and I’ve never felt truly scared by someone ( I did have a brother who passed away when I was younger but I don’t remember that). Recently within the past 3 years maybe 4 I’ve been having crazy shit happen at night and I mean hallucinations. It would only start at night and I would get zero sleep on these days, I would just be laying down in the darkness when I’d start to see shadows in the corner; what was weirder is they were always humanoid shaped and moving from corner to corner. The worst part is this would go on all night till I could see the morning light in my room. 

Most of the time I wouldn’t sleep for 2 nights straight because of this and I would be perfectly fine in the day. I feel like it’s getting worse, I have been stressed about school so I smoke weed/pot occasionally with friends and sometimes at night, but even before I smoked this would happen and it seems it’s started to stop now that I’ve smoked most nights. I’ve taken a tolerance break and it happened again, I could see the shadows walking and I used to be scared but now I’m not, another thing is that my fathers car has this very loud low humming v8. He leaves in morning around 2:00am to work and when I hear this sound slowly pass my room and leave the sound kept ringing in my ears all night, just a low buzzing and would sometimes get super loud then quiet like a music scale. I’d also get these weird visuals all over my field of view like water droplets in a big pond of water just small waves moving textures and shapes around my room changing colors. I’ve never had an explanation for this.

One last thing I want to say is in my daily life I try my best to make things perfect; in the worst way. I try to stack things so they are exact or how I like it (maybe ocd), but I always think something bad will happen if I don’t. Like if the candles aren’t aligned I believe my whole family will be murdered or if I don’t open this door a certain way I’ll die or even placing my water bottle in the exact place every time because in my mind bad stuff is going to happen if I don’t, I always have these feelings where I’m being watched so I’m looking out and making sure I’m not going to murdered by some rando. This has been happening for 3 years since the beginning of high school, I hate school with all my body and I avoid it as much as I can try it just stresses me out so much. The night stuff happens every once every 2-3 months. I just want ti know if this is serious or I’m crazy.

schizophrenia,"hi everyone, i joined this sub reddit 5 days ago, and first of aĺl i admire how all of you have the courage to talk about the ""voices"". Its difficult for me to talk about it because admiting that i hear them is forbidden (by the voices), and if i did, something horrible would happen to my family. 

After a cannabis induced psychothic episode, i was hospitalized because i was a threat to myself after my parents found me. 

i still drink cofee and smoke cigarettes, canabis is out of my sytem for more than 4 months now. 

i still beleive that this threat is real because of the non invasive brainwave analysis by AI. it can become a method of mass surveillance. i want to try and develop a method to false / hide my true intentions from my consciousness to hack this potential danger. But i think like it is only feeding into their training data. The deep state existence is confirmed. And whenever a technology can be weaponized it will be. 

throught some irrational conversation with my self im certain that if i die in any other way than suicide it can only confirm that i pose a threat for ""them"". So the voices will do everything to convice me to hurt my self, and therefore i have to listen to myself. 

I even tried to convice the voices that spying on me for there bosses is counter productive for them LOL. 

It results in tricking my self because of the voices

i dont know how to move foward, i have to do a 6month internship 

somtimes i feel like i can communicate telepathically. logic tells me that I'm have a delusion but it is still so difficult for me to come back to reality. because i hear tiny voices but i can't distinguish what they're saying. I'm battling between logic and delusions. and it goes on forever. sometimes i beleive that im some kind of evolved human being and that I'm being prosecuted by unknown entities, while my reason tells me that I'm imagining scenarios to keep my self entertained. an pathetic attempt to satisfy my ego, make my self interesting. because reality is harsh. 

it is easy to distinguish delusions but it is difficult for me to attach myself back to reality. i get anxiety from the delusions that i know are not real. 

i have nothing special thats the truth, but hearing voices makes me doubt that thus many theory emerges and it makes me lost. 

my most common delusion is telepathatic communication, especially in crowded places, at home too. i doubt everything i know, and my ""talents"" seems to fade, I have no idea what motivates me. the ideals i have are too farfetched and the road to get there seems too difficult. Add the constant delusions of being mind scanned constantly by a group of wealthy individuals, it results in me hallucinating about bunch of nonsense. i laugh at my own contradictions because otherwise its just too depressing.

because im not a diagnosed schizophrenic, I'm not even sure if i actually hear voices or over interpret any sound i hear, or reaction. the worst thing is that i feel privileged to have this condition. I'm like the laughing stock of my oppressors. they are rich, powerful, knowledgeable, and evil ( because of their mind surveillance program) and I procrastinate, have wealthy parents and haven't seized the chance to make something of myself, and ultimately stupid (iq and eq) because of my ignorance and contradictions. 

i should ignore my ideals seize every chance that my enviroment provides for me, while maintaining normal ethic and moral. it would mean pursue my career in finance, work in a financial institution or any company's financial department. i know that i won't be satisfied with this decision (nothing is certain but thats just how i feel for now). and starting something new now is like destroying all the efforts ive put in my studies before i lost my mind. the decision that i have to make now will be  crutial for my future, so im just turning in circles, delaying this decision, and ultimately giving up. 

emotionally, i was bullied in primary school, it is my core trauma, and i use it as an excuse for everything i fail. i don't know how the bullying started, race? age? wealth? these can all serve as an excuse to my overall bad character. in my mind i was beyond reproche, but thats my perception. Sometimes it feels like i have done a terrible thing in my childhood, and i have repressed this memory because it was too much for me, that could be why i was constantly bullied .",introducing myself,[],r/schizophrenia,0.6739347389220144,-0.21034204962500036,-0.21034204962500036,0,1,1,0,0,Equivalent_Client507,-0.35292087808047296,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,20,5

schizophrenia,"Very long rambling post but thank you if you read it all. I am using a throwaway account for privacy.  
For context: homeschooled M16 with no friends and I live in a country different than my home country so I only see my  parents and siblings when it comes to seeing family so I don't have a lot of social pressure.  
In  June of this year, my mom dragged me to a psychiatrist because she was fed up with my actions after thinking for years that something was wrong.

Doctor 1: I could not talk with the first doctor so my mom simply described the  physical actions she sees as ""obsessive"" and I got diagnosed with light OCD. I was put on sertraline 50mg and quetiapine 15mg. There was no improvement.   


Doctor 2: Could not talk again so she changed my meds to clomipramine 75 mg and fluoxamine 50 mg. I had a severe breakdown on these meds. Yelled to my ""fake"" parents to leave me alone because I  believed I was in a dream where something bad was going to happen and I kept hearing sounds of sirens and screams. Banged my head on the wall and tried to jump out of the window to kill myself since when I die in dreams I wake up usually, so that was my strategy to ""wake up"". My parents restrained me until I calmed down. This type of breakdown happens a lot to me and in it usually i accidentally hurt myself,  others, or break objects.   


Next time we went to that doctor my mom said  what happened and I decided to open up a little and said how I think I am being  watched all the time and cannot focus on even my usual  activities on my  desk like studying, drawing, or gaming because I see shadows of things looming over me, look back, and sometimes I either see figures or see nothing. I cannot resist the urge to look back because it always feels so real and threatening.   
\- I use LAN scanning applications to  check all the devices connected to the home network, check the MAC address's vendor and look up what that vendor makes. My worst fear is a vendor that sells anything camera related because I'm scared there will be a camera in my room that will record me or someone could be spying on me.   
\- Another thing is that i often see my mom and talk to her, when she is not even there.  Once while she was traveling  and I swore many times to her that I literally had conversations with her but she denied it.   
\- I often see insects and hear them  crawling in the wall next to my bed,  this can keep me awake at night for  hours. I got a bug repellent and sprayed it in my room and almost  turned it into a gas chamber because I didn't open the window, got caught and that's when I explained to my parents the  reasoning for that. I even once killed  one of the insects to prove to  my parents they're real but my parents always state they are not.   
\- I once believed a man was behind the curtain  and he was going to kill me  violently with his machete that i saw  peaking from the curtain if i  tried to go outside to tell my parents, so I sent images to my online  friend of how the curtain looks and he said it was flat and tried to state to me that it's not real until the meds kicked in and made me sleepy.   
The doctor said for sure I have schizophrenia alongside OCD and  put me on fluoxamine 50mg and quetiapine  25mg. My dad's cousin has  schizophrenia too so the doctor said it was genetic.   


Doctor 3: My parents did not like doctor 2's attitude so we went  to another one this morning.   
He says i don't have schizophrenia and it's just OCD. He put me on fluoxamine 200mg and aripiprazole 5mg. He says my hallucinations are normal things that everyone experiences. He said I act too normal and I'm talking to him normally so clearly I'm not sick with it.   


I'm so fed up with psychiatrists trying to mess up my  brain with meds that alter brain chemistry and I want to quit going there and to quit my meds but my parents won't let me. I feel like a lab rat right now. I hate this all and I want my normal life because I was such a smart kid. I'm still smart I believe because I'm graduating 2  years early in 6 months because I finished all needed highschool exams in only 2 years  instead of 4 but this is all so stressful.

Other symptoms I have: I have frequent handwashing and contamination OCD symptoms that sometimes I do not eat anything at all because I cannot get myself to go to the kitchen and touch all the dirty surfaces  and touch the dangerous tools that can kill me and the fact that someone can be staring and hiding in the kitchen or poison could be put in  place in one of the jars or bottles of food or drinks.   
Sometimes I see violent very visual or even auditory or physically sensational intrusive thoughts that are very violent and disgusting. My dreams  lately keep having disgusting sexual and gory immoral themes like me running babies over and shooting them in  the head and me violating my female family members even though I would never do it and I wake up feeling so ashamed that I think about  suicide.   
I believe my hands are evil because they make me waste time and I can hurt others with it so I  once tried to amputate it at home but failed because my parents came in and saw the scene before I did any  severe damage. I still believe I have an evil hand and my life would be better if i lost my right hand. I hear voices calling my name daily and see shadow figures or shadows of things where shadows should not be present.   
I get aggressive  when i try to protect my siblings from  possible harm like if one of  them is trying to hold a knife to cut fruit, I will get mad and yell without being able to control myself to take the knife before they stab themselves with it.   
The number 127 was a  number i got 4 times in a row from reading alternating dark and light reflections of light in different places in my house as binary code and converting it to a  ecimal number. The number 127 happened to be the ASCII escape code  for the ""DEL"" character and that  number horrifies me because I know it  means i need to delete something but as I don't know what it is, I always delete any files on my computer or throw away any object that has 127 on it. Once I scrapped a drawing I was working for days on because I realized it was 127 kilobytes and I shut off my computer promptly.

Is it possible to be aware of myself (most of the time, sometimes i'm not and I forget completely what happened or have faint memory of it) and have schizophrenia?

schizophrenia,"So, here's me story.

My teens were rough. Big episodes that still haunt me. Fully diagnosed very early 20s by another major episode that left me heavily burnt. Literally. I see my psychiatrist once a month to manage it. I recently spoke with them about the major incidents, they spoke about how unwell I was. How scared they were as I was so unwell they weren't sure how I would or if I could recover.

Here I am, 10 years later. Pretty much symptom free. With family and a somewhat steady job.

Everyday taking meds, everyday reminders of how fragile reality is. Scared of my future. Scared for my kids and their own MH futures.

schizophrenia,"Hello. I came here to describe my friend who has schizophrenia and if somebody could tell me if his symptoms are normal for this condition or are they the cause of the meds he takes or what. I would like to understand him more. I would like to educate myself some more on this.

So basically my friend who is 31 now, developed schizophrenia around 7 - 10 years ago. He doesn't like to talk about it. He did confirm to me that he has it and I also know this from other people. We live in a relatively small town. But he doesn't like to discuss anything about it. If I carefully ask him anything about it, he sometimes gets really defensive. He will just tell me that he does take meds and sometimes he doesn't want to take them and I know that he had a period where he wasn't taking them and i think his symptoms were worse at that time. Another thing I want to mention is that this condition probably came to him because he had a period where he did drugs every weekend (mostly ecstasy) and it really messed him up at that time. He still smokes weed occasionally and I keep telling him to not do any of that stuff and to try to live as healthy as possible but he won't listen. I sometimes take him with me to the gym or running but he lacks determination. 

So the main thing why I came here is to describe his symptoms: He has some really really strong concentration problems... You need to be really patient when you talk with him. It's very hard to even have a conversation with him. He will forget almost everything you tell him immediately and will often ask you the same thing five times or more. For example; if i tell him something he will always first respond with a pre-prepared response like ""that's cool"" or ""really?"" or something like that and I know that he didn't even register what I told him. I then wait 5-10 sec and then it finally gets to him and he responds appropriately then. I have to be sure to not say another sentence in that 10 seconds or I will just confuse him further. So it's very hard to talk with him, very hard to tell him longer and connected sentences because he just won't be able to follow. He knows he has this problems but it's impossible to discuss this with him because you can't explain anything to him and even if you go really slow he will just forget 80% of it...

He has parents and a brother that probably do a lot for him and he does visit his doctor frequently. That's all I know. Honestly I just miss my friend. He used to be the most outgoing person that was really fun to hang out with and everyone loved him. Now, it's impossible to have a real conversation with him. I apologize if I am ignorant but I know almost nothing about this condition and if someone could educate me on what he is going through, so that I can be more understanding of him. Are his concentration problems normal for schizophrenia or could this be due to something more?

schizophrenia,"So, I've been labeled as depressive with psychotic symptoms by my former doctor. My gf thinks I'm actually schizophrenic (she has experience considering she is, herself), and hallucinations seem to confuse me a bit. 

I've always had intrusive thoughts, and there's a thing called ""visual intrusive thoughts"" where someone who's a visual thinker will get intrusive thoughts, but they're visual (i.e; thoughts, but they're pictures instead of words). I've explained a few of my experiences to her and she's said they're hallucinations but they don't seem to fit the clinical definitions of hallucinations. 

Example; the clinical definition says hallucinations feel 100% real to the person who's hallucinating. To me they don't necessarily feel 100% real, rather, they feel like something that's overlaying my world, rather than being a part of it. One of the only ways I've been able to describe this so far is with an example of art

* If you look at a digital canvas you have different layers, and each layer can have a transparency from 0% (invisible) to 100% (you see every detail and nothing that might be under/behind the image). What she's said are hallucinations, I generally see with around 10%-25% transparency. For instance, if I thought someone was in a hallway, and nobody actually was, then the person is as seeing would look almost transparent to me, and eventually would fade away. Think of a ghost; you can see though them but you know they're there. 

I've always referred to things like this as visual intrusive thoughts because they're not 100% real as if looking at the person in real life, rather they're just kind of overlayed in my reality.

schizophrenia,"Hello, my name is Ethan I am new to the subreddit and reddit as a whole a little about myself before the rest of this post. I am a 3rd year student at a university for game design, but I have other hobbies like leather work where I craft sneakers, writing, and also really enjoy film. I like to diverse myself in creative endeavors and be introduced to new ones!

Reason for the post is that I am working on a video game for my academic project to depict schizophrenia. Reason being- after developing research papers around the project topic, it is not a topic depicted appropriately in mainstream games, leading to stereotypes and stigmas in the game space, especially showing the uneducated few on the topic. Movies and television often get criticism for what happens on screen, but I rarely see any video games that have done the same receive the same amount (especially with prominent characters). So, with my experience with mental illness between family and friends I wanted to attempt in creating an experience around a certain number of symptoms/experiences for a player to go through to understand some extent schizophrenia. I know a game like *Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice* is highly acclaimed in portraying psychosis. Though I jumped into this project to do the same and I wish to spread awareness by the end. I have read post about experiences, but never spoke to people appropriately or ethically feel comfortable in taking post and throwing them into a game.

So, I am here just asking for some advice and insight on the topic to be depicted in a game. If there is something I should focus on or something to stray away from it can help. If there are any misunderstandings that I may have that could be corrected. I do not want something negative or offensive in my portfolio or record to end my career before it starts, so anything helps. If some proof is required of this project, I have written papers and create game components, and do not mind sharing. I am not here to collect information as a form of studies of someone's experiences or opinion nor do I intent to survey, poll, or interview through this post.

Lastly, I know something like this would not be perfectly created or established, everyone is different. It would be solely on myself, but I am trying my best on all points to make sure my efforts would achieve something positively. I will try my best to respond to any comments or messages, thank you in advance.

Story: 

Recently I started drawing again for the first time in 2 years. I used to be a fine arts grad but I withdrew from classes to go travelling. During that time Covid happened and couldn’t travel so I went to stay with family in Vancouver (main family is in Toronto). I had a psychotic break and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. I worked for a year then couldn’t work bc of schizophrenia. 

A year later, back in TO, I started drawing again and I’m scared of what the antipsychotics and diagnosis/voices will do to my art. I’m definitely out of practice but I hear the voices say ‘I’ll take everything you learned at (my university)’ and other threats to ‘take away my art’. I’m worried that I will regress in skill due to medication and schizophrenia. The further I practice the more my art will be reduced instead of improving.

I think one was abilify, and the other one might have been the risperdal injectable, but the most recent injectable that the nurse says I received was haloperidol, which would have made that one the one with lowest level of EPSs, but it was still hard to cope with as I wasn't taking an anticholinergic like I do with my current meds.

So I wanted to ask if anyone that has tried an injectable, which one and did you experience akathisia on it? Is there an injectable you recommend, and is there any other medications or practices that helped with side effects?

Are there any people here who actually got more creative and intellectual WITH antipsychotics?  
I already considered to reduce my medication and take this risk, of course in agreement with my psychatrist. I'd rather have a colorful mind than a sane, but dull mind.

schizophrenia,"To start, this post is by no means condoning sudden withdrawal of medication. It’s always safer to contact your doctor about it first.

For background information, I’ve been on medication for psychosis, mood issues, and anxiety for around six years now (much of that time only being for mood). I always felt that it never treated my issues beyond hallucinations and delusions, rather only displaying healthier external behaviors. I’d be less isolated and more outgoing, but personally, I still didn’t feel too hot. Every time it had been a while since a medication update, the issues would be too unbearable for them to mask themselves and it’d repeat.

The same cycle, lasting 3-6 months each, for six years. Constant overthinking, irritation in struggling to express myself, and nightly senses of restlessness and despair.

Not the best choice, but I decided to cut off the source behind the back of my mom, who acts as my caretaker. I want to make it clear that I know it’s not safe and I’ve been having awful physical withdrawals, I just don’t want to cause conflict with her.

It’s been a bit more than a week and I’m managing it surprisingly well. The most positive outcome being: I’m completely numbed out. For the first time in all those years, I haven’t been weighed down by my emotions. I can cry and laugh out of habit or instinct, but there’s no feeling backing it. The only thing I can feel is the pure relief of being away from it all.

To those who may read this and be concerned for my physical withdrawal symptoms: I will be discussing it with my psychiatrist tomorrow. My thought is that, if I can explain this to an unbiased healthcare worker and gain a go-ahead, I can go about this the rest of the way much safer with my mother’s trust in his judgment on my decision.

I’m so relieved that my mind is at peace with everything. I realize medication can be life-saving for so many others, but I’ll be living without it unless something concerning comes up.

My mum has had schizophrenia all my life (30 years) and always had an issue with medication compliance which usually leading her into hospital admission for about 1 month. 

Over the last year, she has gotten worse and is unable to recognise that she is unwell and thinks the medication is poison for her. 

Her symptoms are these delusions where she owns this really nice house and is the owner of a shopping mall. Few months ago, she acted on this thought and went to the house and demanded the people who lived there to get out of the house. Police were involved. 

Currently mum is on the maximum dosage of a depot injection of a medication that I can’t remember the name of. She is also advised to take quintiapine once per night however is non-compliant. 

Just wondering if anyone had any advice or tips for me as I am finding it very difficult to hold a relationship with my mum as all she does is brings up her delusions and she absolutely hates me as I am on the side of the medical team and advising her to keep taking her medication.

schizophrenia,"Is it possible that the medication itself is causing some of the negative symptoms?

I started with 15mg Abilify three years ago, now I am on 5mg Abilify and my symptoms are:

\- weak memory

\- difficulty focusing, walking in the room a lot

\- poverty of speech. I noticed my thoughts are about schizophrenia only or blank, no thoughts. It was not this way before taking medication.

\- boredom most of the time- this was unimaginable to me before taking medication. I cannot do a thing because of boredom. I mean I manage to study about 3 hours a day, cook (sometimes my husband cooks) and take care of myself but other than that I am just bored.

I had weak memory since childhood, or at least since high school and I used to talk little but not as little as now. Or is it the illness progressing.

schizophrenia,"Hi. I am a diagnosed schizophrenic but in pretty good shape. I had hit about 80% recovery with salt / c, which killed off an apparent spirochete infection and cleared my mind up in large part. But I still had very isolated thought blocks and travelling sensations in my brain, like a worm was moving around. 

It is my understanding that salt / c isn't good enough to kill larger worms like Ascaris Suum, so some heavier duty thing is needed.

Enter black seed oil. Amazing stuff. Very anti-parasitic -and- good for sperm counts! Usually they're bad for such counts but this substance is very pro-health apparently.

I was sitting down and trying to code a large project, but was always being brain blocked, like my mind wasn't being allowed to think of higher minded things against the verbal onslaught of this alleged ""group"" that wanted to take hold of my mind. But as soon as I reasoned it was a worm that needed weakening / killing, I took multiple teaspoons of the oil until that goddamned thing dislodged and started slithering around. 

Now that part of my mind is unblocked, but my whole brain doesn't feel ""fresh"" like it did in my youth. But I feel that is the ultimate resolution.

This is only day two though.

I started noticing my hearing drifting, like I couldn't hear anything around me, everything sounded alien, I kept snapping beside my ear to try and ground myself to the sounds that were actually around me but it didn't work.

when I was walking back up to my room I noticed my vision is a absolute mess, I'm looking at some cheap heavy psychedelic visual effects, time started speeding up rapidly then slowing down rapidly and now time doesn't exist at all, that's when I started seeing a shadow person appear in the corner of my vision and they keep running at me which normally would be like AAAAHHHH but it's not that scary because 1. It isn't Halloween and 2. This room isn't that big so why are you even running it's just like you're trying too hard to be scary.

I guess they didn't like that thought because now they aren't there and I'm hearing doors opening, light switches flickering, and foot steps all in my room but it's just kinda like stop fucking around with me and fight me already so I can consume your dark matter like when I was nine.

(The first time they tricked me with a portal and I entered the portal and then a lion tried to kill me but I used magic powers to freeze it into a ice cube then later that night I was attacked by colorful skeletons and saw my twin brother levitating off his bed while telepathically communicating with me the next day he said that none of that happened and I was like UH HUH YEAH IT DID)

schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, I’m new here. I was hospitalized since November 21st, 2023 until December 30th, 2023. 

I believed that I was hearing voices from Jesus and that he wanted me dead. When I was working retail, I began paying for customers groceries and acting strange. I stopped taking my medication and lied to everyone that I was still taking it. I stabbed myself with a knife. I almost killed my mom. 

In the hospital, I had ECT (electric compulsive treatment) which led me to forgetting what had happened when I was schizophrenic. We had a lot of group therapy sessions. It was extremely boring in the hospital and I hope I never have to go back again.

I’m actually still schizophrenic and still hear voices if I allowed myself to talk out loud. My mouth automatically moves on its own and words come out. My rectum also moves and has a voice of its own as well. Nowadays, I’m left extremely restless and can’t stop moving.

Leading up to this, I did marijuana, mushrooms, vaping, and certain drugs. I now know that I never wanna do marijuana again because I don’t want to trigger schizophrenia. I don’t wanna do drugs anymore either. 

Honestly, I just want to lead a normal life and get in a relationship with someone and be happy. I don’t want to do drugs anymore and I don’t want to have another schizophrenic episode. I don’t want to stress or endanger my parents. I don’t want to find out more about my schizophrenia by letting my mouth move on it’s own and talking in tongues.

I thought hard what could be the thing I am not too bad at and it could be:

\- integrated maths (high school basic course)

\- HTML/CSS, basic Javascript

 \- B2 English (Upper Intermediate)

\- maybe ancient history but not sure

I enjoy learning about k-12 education. How it is different now than it used to be, how it is different in other countries, what are common mistakes in kids' mathematics, etc. 

I would need to revise the topics if I was to do something with it, but I am not bad at these.

What I definitely could not do is teaching in person because of poverty of speech (I only have it in real life, it seems) and getting weak when talking to the audience.

I could:

\- make a website with text courses in my native language with many exercises

\- contribute on Brainly

\- write a fiction/non fiction book

I don't work here (I live abroad) because this would most probably require me to know the language of the country plus additional supplemental language the minority speaks. Only corporate don't require estonian and russian.  I cannot live in my own country because my husband is a foreigner. I live abroad since 7 years now and consider myself unemployable. Even if I had an opportunity, not sure if I took it because of my negative symptoms and not really being good at anything.

schizophrenia,"By: Steven Zilberg

All my life; I have walked in the footsteps of ‘take me as I am or leave me alone’.
Why?
Such a question requires an honest answer.
Are you patient?
Such an answer requires enough time for us to enjoy a cup of coffee together while enjoying the ocean breeze.

—

It is true,
People do change or at least we all were blessed with ability to adapt.
In most cases, it is possible.
In some cases, it is nearly impossible.

People like me; AA or NA doesn’t exist.
People like me; support groups are not ‘magical cures’.
People like me; no amount of prayers, holy books, or scripture verses can silence the voices.

Schizophrenia is a fucking beast.
It is a savage animal that claws, bites, and stalks its prey.
It doesn’t retreat nor does it take ‘breaks’.
It is a 24/7 adrenaline junkie that seeks to wear down, torture, and confuse its prey.

We aren’t ‘broken’ or ‘cracked’ screens that you can take to a mall shop to be fixed or replaced.
We aren’t ‘projects’ that you can ‘work on’ for extra credit.

—

I have seen,
I have experienced it.
My ex wife,
My adopted parents,
College buddies,
Past lovers and friends with benefits,
It didn’t matter what gender, skin color, or political beliefs they had;

In the past,
I flirted with both men and women,
In the past,
I ate pussy and sucked dick,
In the past,
I let girls and guys tie me up,
In the past,
I was stretched out by real dick and toys.
It didn’t matter how long we dated or how long we had been friends;

As soon as I became ‘not useful’,
As soon as the ‘fun’ ended,
As soon as they were ‘tired of me’,

I found myself alone in a room,
No one sitting across from me,
Both cups of coffee cold,
Behind me stood three ‘evils’.
Behind me three ‘beasts’ whispered in my ear;
‘Didn’t we tell you this would happen?’.

—

It didn’t matter if we both shared similar hobbies,
It didn’t matter how many things we had in common,
I was just a ‘play thing’.
I was just a ‘fling’.

No matter how hard I tried to change,
No matter how medicated I was,
No matter how many times I attended therapy,

It never was enough.
Alex, Josephine, Bella, Caleb, Tyrone, Michelle, India, and Lily,
Kim, Charlie, Oscar, Fatima, Zeynab, Mohammed, and Clifton.

It took only one psychotic break.
It took only one episode of following a zombie Abraham Lincoln in a grocery store for all of them to pack their shit and leave without a note or even a text.

—

When I say,
‘Just as I am’,
What do you think it means?
Take your time,
Have a sip of coffee,
Think before you speak;
“It means take me as I am”.

—

Brief smile.
Sun’s reflection upon the sea.
You are correct.
I am unable to change who I am;
I am unable to build a TARDIS,

No matter how hard I try,
No doctor or surgeon can remove ‘schizophrenia’ from my brain.

I might be troubled.
I might be crazy.
I might not be able to provide ‘everything’ someone wants;

What can I do?
I can provide laughter.
I can provide comfort.
I can provide unconditional love.

It is true,
I can’t provide ‘promises’ or ‘a boring life’.
If someone dares to stay instead of leaving in the middle of the night or early in the morning,

They will witness chaos.
They will witness ups and downs.
They will witness just how cruel ‘Charlie, Xavier, and Cassandra’ can be,
They will witness an imperfect lover who dares to give everything they have left to whoever is willing to stay,

—

In the beginning,
I asked if you had enough time to enjoy a cup of coffee,
It seems that you kept your promise,
In this case,
Would you like to walk along the beach as a sign of friendship?

schizophrenia,"Hi everyone, 

I found this community so I could better understand my mom’s conditions and learn how to support her better. 

She’s been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. She is also an alcoholic and dabbles in mind-altering drugs and has been on and off in rehab (2 years but no longer) and has been increasingly experiencing audio &amp; visual hallucinations with an increased level of paranoia. 

I don’t live in the same town and it’s very difficult for me to provide support (outside of financial support for medicine) for her. 

She was recently prescribed Ambilify (15 mg) but is currently too scared to begin taking it. I’m also in the process of trying to better understand treatments. She’s at the point where she says if the voices and vibrations don’t get better… they will kill her. My other siblings are estranged/don’t want anything to do with her and she lacks significant support system. So I’m increasingly concerned about her life and really anxious.

schizophrenia,"Hello,

I’d like to share my experience regarding two supplements I’ve been taking for the current week that may have helped me in reaching this sort of calmness of mind (not totally but I’m planning to keep taking these supplements for more time) 

So as you can see the first pic is the stress levels which this week have been dropping because even tho I didn’t do much this week my routine was the same.

On the second pic you can the lower points in white, which indicates the fatigue points so to say the blue points are the peak energy of the day (you start with the blue point and the dot drops as you get tired in the day) so the lower white dots are the score in which I’ve ended the day (still tired but hoping to do better)

So now the “secret”, I’ve been taking Taurine 1g every 4h of the day for a total max dose of 3g in a day.

The second is Zinc Bisglycinate 50mg from a well known orange and white supplement brand.

Now from what I’ve read the Zinc balances both GABA and Glutamate maintaining homeostasis. Taurine on the other side can balance excessive glutamate levels as well and a double blind study also noted that can help with psychosis in general.

schizophrenia,"(Long post sorry)

I think that there is some group of people who watch everyone and when they see potential, or someone suffering, they use technology to teach them and help them grow. And these are the silent voices I hear. More like I just know what’s being said than a voice. I feel like there is a group of people who put a lot of time and effort into helping people overcome their problems and the best way to help is to do it remotely. But they are always watching. And they talk to me.

 My voices are back and it used to go through every terrible moment of my life and talk about it so I wouldn’t implode. Every little secret I had. I feel I have been watched for a long time. All those secrets came back to me in ways I had not remembered. The detail was shocking, I only remember when I went through hallucinations like that. They literally hurt at the time.

Unfortunately, I believe I am special and loved. It is good when the voices are back and I can feel the peace and love of being helped and that someone knows just how fucken hard everything has been for me and can see how much I try and my self discipline. The recognition makes me very confident. I need to know I am being watched cause I work so hard. It was hard at first cause I hate myself so much that I can’t handle people knowing anything about me. Even to this day. But it goes away for months at a time and I forget all about how good I feel when someone appreciates me and my effort. 

I wish my internal world was real. I am convinced right now that it is and I am elated. But I know it will come back around to my empty self. Without the input of the voices, I really hate myself and I treat myself very badly. But I still try to do what’s best for others. I just don’t want it to go away again. It’s the only time I don’t hate myself.

Similar experiences? I have also had the regular psychotic experiences, people trying to kill me, everyone talking about me, people trying to poison me, but it always bounces back to some kind of helping lesson.

Whether or not I was on the autism spectrum never crossed my mind, but neither did my sexuality or my mental health until I was into my 20's it was just something I never considered and even now it seems like maybe there's no way, but when I had my last episode getting off my meds (vraylar 3mg) I would experience moments (particularlly cannabis enduced) and the only way I can describe this is being thrust into a mindstate of autism. Logical sequencial internal monologue with pauses and moving over to different topics temporarily to get al the puzzle pieces and then go back to the previous moment in my head and put them there. But it was a whole experience not just like regular thoughts in my head. And from the way I've heard people who have Autism think sometimes it truly made me believe that multiple times.

The reason they mentioned it is because they think therapy wont help me because im too complex and difficult and that i need intensive care at a psychward for months, which i dont want to do at all. I feel like trash because I'm too hard to deal with apparently and can't get the help like everyone else bc I'm too much. All i get is medication and thats it psychiatrist and therapy wise

schizophrenia,"Hello all,

I'm a sociopath that was targeted by The Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships (CP3)'s threat assessment and management teams. I'm a recreational drug user for 4 years, in the past few months I began hearing voices. However, I was a mental health professional and took pride in my ability to help my clients who suffered from schizoaffective disorders. What I'm trying to say is, I know what's real and what's not.

After months of hearing voices, and research out of my field - I've deducted that I am being targeted by remote neural monitoring technology used by my local law enforcement agency. This technology simulates schizoaffective disorder. I've already ceased drug use and anti-social violent behavior, but they still insist that I take anti-psychotic medication.

The point of this post is to spread awareness on synthetic schizophrenia as well as disprove the myth that ""drug-induced psychosis"" exists. Why does drug-induced psychosis occur in so many young men across the country? Well the answer is that it's induced by law enforcement working with paid informants to prevent violence before it begins. Drug induced psychosis is a myth fabricated by our government to lobotomize potential risks of violence (young men with violent thoughts). 

My personal questions to the schizo-affected community is what side effects they experience on anti-psychotics and which ones they recommend. I do not want to lose my sex drive or my capacity to learn and retain information. If there is constant brain fog and I lose all sense of arousal, I would rather deal with the RNM technology.

 Cars that pass him are following him or are illuminati paid actors, birds following him are controlled by witches, strangers walking by are hitmen. Recording strangers walking by and having verbal altercations with some threating to fight them. some stuff about shapeshifters?? 

he has left comments on some of his shorts going into more detail, one i saw was deranged im not sure if he was actually fighting somebody. but this is it;

 ""The tall caunt is in that car, her brother shapeshifted into some British phag and tried to start shiatsu with me, next time I see him its ON. The tall caunt is there if theres a fight she will help him by attacking me from behind as a ghost and make me lose, like she did at the park with her brother and broke my knuckle by pushing me from behind and only my right hand broke not left when I was throwing hard punches with both hands. She did the same with my thumb on my right hand back in april, dislocated it by pushing me from behind as a ghost. The ""right"" theme that serves her also trying to force me because of her ego, lock me in a room with her and see what happens. These old geasers who supply the ID's so they can shapeshift and roam free in public. One day they will get their comeuppance.""

I want to shine a light related to alogia and how do I get better over time. It was a long time since I suffered from this (like 4 years) and I was thinking to post here in case someone want to hear my story of recovery.  


Before my illness I was a quite guy but not that quieter. I used to spoke in medium sentences using the right amount of speech (not much but not little either like I used to say with alogia).  My alogia was mild says the doctors because I wasn't used sounds to comunicate only speaking in a short sentences such as yes or not or sometimes asking few question.  


  
Now I'm pretty much recovered when it comes to Alogia since I spoke like I used to before somethimes even better. For those who still struggles with alogia give it times and I believe that you can recover too. I tried severals pills to do that along with my doctor and afterone month on Piracetam my speech and toughts appears from nowhere. So I believe it's related to chemistry in our schizophrenic brain even if experts arren't sure yet. If you watch Living Well With Schizophrenia channel, Laurel says she was struggling with alogia throught out period of her illness and she clearly made a recovery.

schizophrenia,"(Diagnosed with ADHD and Bipolar 2, suspected Autism)

Last night i missed my dose of abilify and i woke up at 6 am after an extremely off-putting dream. it felt very odd honestly and it gave very specific bad feeling.

After waking up, the room was very disorienting. Things kind of seemed 2D and the colors were very block-like. It felt like childhood sort of. I kept trying to shake the dream but very graphic flashes would keep popping up in my mind.

I then went to my bathroom and kept the lights open and played Tetris for a while since I saw a post on social media saying that playing it as long as possible after a traumatic event can lessen the impact and it sort of worked. The memory of the dream didn't really stay in my mind long-term.

I've been getting these sort of psychosis-like episodes more often lately even with the Abilify and I feel a little worried that it might be schizophrenia. Not that there's anything wrong with being diagnosed, but I do know it can be very debilitating.

Should I get myself checked? What next steps should I take? How do I lessen the frequency of having these episodes?

I find myself growing more and more paranoid that I'm losing my mind. What could be causing these sensations?

I'm specifically worried it may be schizophrenia since the ADHD and Bipolar symptoms can overlap. I've also found that I've changed a lot the past year in the sense that I've become more withdrawn socially and have been experiencing more frequent manic episodes.","Anyone else have weird, off-putting dreams when you forget to take antipsychotics at night?",[],r/schizophrenia,0.6739347389220144,-0.250551609116124,-0.250551609116124,0,1,0,0,0,shvlhbsh,-0.2854965236930938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,12,1

schizophrenia,"I had a lot of bursts of angriness, would have awful argument, being paranoid, and ended up losing tone of friends and losing family support. And then I would feel terribly humiliated and ashamed of being such an awful friend and human being. Some old friend even told me that I was the most self-untitled bitch she ever seen. This is what helped me the most to fight less and keep my friends.

**1st, it may be counterintuitive, but the first emotion you need to manage is not anger, it's shame.** Shame as an emotion is super toxic for your brain, and schizophrenic brain triggers an insane level of shame. Very few people talk about it, but shame is the emotion of schizophrenia, the same that sadness is the emotion of depression, and anxiety is the emotion of anxiety disorder. It means that it both aggravates your disease, AND is overproduced by your sick brain.

How to deal with shame, so that your brain can rest and produce less anger? Auto-compassion is the way to regulate shame. You can take a time for yourself, think about your experience of having all this shame and facing all these awful events and gives yourself the loving embrace a parent would give to a lost child. Tell yourself how much you understand that you are having a terrible time. You can hug a pillow against your chest while doing that, cry and imagining yourself as a child. If done properly, self-compassion can help you to move from shame and access guilt, which is a less toxic emotion and gives you the will to change. (Shame is more about wanting to hide and disappear, guilt is more about understanding you don't want to act not in accord with your values, and the truth is that you have great values, you don't want to have fight with your family and friends.) (Side note: shame can mutate in pride. It is super damaging for your relationship too. If you see yourself sliding in the ""I am superior"" mindset, take yourself back to self-compassion, acceptance and healthy guilt).

**2nd, how to regulate paranoia?** Paranoia is super tricky. I deal with it both with self-help stuff (like described here : [https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/](https://mind.help/topic/paranoia/coping/)), direct communication (""I may be wrong, but I am afraid X, Y, Z is happening and it makes me feel angry and sad, I am right ?"") and by having some trustworthy people that are aware of my condition and help me to deal with people when I am paranoid. For example, I make my husband read my angry messages before sending them, he validates my anger and tells me when I am going too far. He is very good in non-violent communication and active listening, and de-escalate me when I am getting super angry against someone else. So, find the most emotionally intelligent person in your surroundings, be honest with them and ask them to call you out when you are getting paranoid. This is a difficult role. They must be super good in active listening, emotion validation, and boundaries setting.

**3rd, how to regulate anger?** Anger is an emotion that tell us that our space/boundaries is invaded. So, the easiest way to get it lower is to separate us physically from what makes us angry. If you feel you are too angry, just go away. Far. Far from the person, from your phone or computer if you are having online argument. Anger is also an emotion that is powerful and needs to be expressed. So write down how angry you are AND DONT SEND IT !!! It is only for your emotion to get out of your body. And also, last resort: the ""and then what ??"" game. Repeat yourself ""and then what ??"" until you don’t give a fuck about the situation. When you have done all of that, if still angry, examine if you need to express one boundary, and have the conversation in the nicest way possible.

**4th, how to repair?** A lot of people are not able to understand what we are going through, but some will and will accept our repair attempt. And know that in relationships, connecting after an argument is more important than not having arguments. Learn how to give proper apologies ([https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology](https://www.npr.org/2023/01/25/1150972343/how-to-say-sorry-give-good-apology) ). I lost many friends for ever at the beginning of my disease. But some family members that I have deeply hurt are now strong allies in my recovery. I also abandon the idea that everything is fixable. Some of my bad behaviors are not fixable, and I am ok with that. When I lose some friends, I go back to self-compassion and accept that my actions have consequences, even if caused by a terrible disease.

I still have anger issues, but less often, and life is getting easier as I progress in emotion regulation.

schizophrenia,"Because of drug addiction I had schizophrenia + depression which now after 10 years down the road I learnt I also have anxiety, ocd &amp; adhd somewhat I feel. Got diagnosed with adhd when I was 12. Don’t know wth is ADHD as an adult because the place where I’m at, people who have mental illnesses are just taboo. Everyone is afraid of people with &amp; especially with schizophrenia. Lol which I think is stupid. They should read up about it. This place is stupid. It’s a love hate thing. 

Anyways I’m an addict as well, somewhat. I like to get high but I don’t do it everyday. I always do it on impulse. -alcohol now. People say I’m an addict I’m just agreeing with them because I don’t know wtf I am and how I am to others but I sure as hell don’t feel like one. -An addict. But I am. 

Used to do meth, ketamine, weed, eramin 5 when I was younger, honestly I wished I never did but I learnt somethings about life &amp; about myself &amp; about God. Don’t mean people should do drugs to learn stuff. That’s stupid.

Mental illness is not contagious fyi to anyone who needs to know. A healthy person can’t “catch” mental illness. That’s what I learnt after many years. 

Everyone is different, everyone goes through life differently. We’re not one. We will never be &amp; we have never been. We’re all chosen people, by God. If you don’t believe in God then, you are made to live this life where you get to experience because you’re that one sperm out of hundreds. So just think yourself as chosen k.

A person trying to live right, a good person, a giver, a listener, a compassionate person, you get the picture. Just trying to be the best person I can be. Which I think is right. Also ngl I love God, and God has been my foundation &amp; help through all my troubled times.

So I was formally diagnosed with schizoforum disorder when I was 15. In that time, I've had an almost rotating amount of Hallucinations - or, as my doctor and I have dubbed them, my ""Cast of Characters"" - that come and go as I've grown up (I'm 24 now). 

However, I'm worried that it makes me look like I'm faking, even though both doctor and therapist have told me that there is no way that I could be faking, because I meet everything needed to have a diagnosis in the first place. Especially because my hallucinations aren't just audible or visual - the visual matches the auditory, so when the hallucination talks, the voice matches the figure. 

I've always been self-conscious about it, because I know it sounds weird, but does anyone else have some experience with that? Anyone else's hallucinations more nice than mean?

Experiencing confirmation bias consistently might create a sense of being at the center of one's personal universe. In the context of schizophrenia, Individuals with might unconsciously display confirmation biases and store these instances in a mental archive. This archive could influence their perception of reality and their place within it. This could stem from the constant need for approval or validation, whether intentional or unintentional, as the confirmation bias itself is a tool for reinforcing the ego. Both unintentional and deliberate validation may coexist.

schizophrenia,"I’ve known them for 7 years, they know I have delusions and hallucinations but I only talk about them in passing or jokes, I never talk about it seriously. I am ridiculously closed off from people and it takes years if ever for me to be somewhat vulnerable. Lately I have just been in pain. I at the time had been for several weeks, deteriorating with my mental health and I reached a point where I needed to vent or I was going to explode. 


I left a voice memo telling them about how utterly ashamed I feel to have these types of problems (hallucinations + delusions) and, lamented about how lately I’ve been insecure with the way I speak when we get to talk. Their reply made my heart totally drop. They commented that they noticed I’ve been acting really out of it lately, and cited an example of them making a joke to me on the phone. They said I apparently got scared and took it ‘really seriously’ which made them feel guilty for messing with me like that when it wasn’t their intention. And they followed this all up asking me if I was okay and if I was having an episode. 


Which immediately just made me cry with humiliation. For one, because I didn’t know what they were talking about when they told me that story about them apparently scaring me with a comment they said. Which tells me I’m either having memory black-outs, or we both interpreted a situation completely differently. Which touches on exactly the point I had made to him earlier, that the biggest part of all this that embarrasses me, is when people aren’t able to believe my point-of-view because I can’t be ‘trusted’ to ‘interpret reality’. And its not at all that my friend is being rude to me or incorrect with information, it just thoroughly upsets me that this really is the impression I give people. Crazy person. 


I just feel horrible. From how they said it, it sounded like that little ‘event’ they noticed, they didn’t plan on bringing it up to me. Which makes me think, how many things am I doing that strike them as so weird or concerning, that they don’t tell me about? Am I making them think I’m crazy all the time and I just don’t know it?

schizophrenia,"Hi I am the little sibling of a brother who has recently developed schizophrenia.

Recently my brother had a delusion where he has no mental illness and doesn’t have schizophrenia. This is terrifying to me because he was recognizing he had it it felt like there was a chance we can move forward and try to get him medicated or at the very least allow him to use his schizophrenia to get on disability because he is currently living in aweful poverty in the other side of the country so I never get to see him physically and to let him ask my opinion on a delusion for reassurance (idk how much that would actually help but at the very least then I could know what’s going on because his situation is so horrible and I only have his words to go off of so it’s like my understanding of his life had the same schizophrenia filter on it. 

The only time I know for certain when he is telling me stuff that is a delusion is when it is text book like tearing off drywall looking for cameras, or him sending me a picture of something innocent and then sending a string of texts connecting that to a conspiracy while staring the the picture is of body bags when it is not.

When I am certain his delusions are false I don’t try to outright prove him wrong. I just want him to feel better and I am aware that when he takes a picture of a leaf and sees it as a dead body it is completely out of his control. My current understanding is that i don’t need to prove to him a delusion is false I don’t know like if that is even doable (please someone confirm or deny how possible to is to help a person with schizophrenia realize a delusion is false) but I assume it is incredibly difficult and often not worse because it risks agitating my brother, and would probably result in him justifying the delusion further cementing it in place.

Talking to my brother is very draining I haven’t spoken to him in the 4 years and I still live with my parents and he is on his own. I want to be able to talk to him about the stuff that goes on in his life so I know what’s going on but I never know when he is telling me about what’s happening in his life and his delusion (I don’t want him to avoid telling me about his delusions ever, they effect his mental state so much they are a part of his life and effect him just as much as his physical situation) but I dread conversations with him because I am very out of practice with talking to my brother the last time I did he didn’t have schizophrenia so I struggle to make conversation which results in him mostly venting, I am ok with him doing this I am ok with feeling a little drained after words it’s worth it to stay in touch and to give him a chance to vent and me to try and comfort, but I am scared by letting him vent I am hurting him more so this is something else I would like an opinion on. 

I just worry by letting him vent I am giving him more time space to allow the delusions to control his throughts which must not be good, but he also doesn’t have anyone else to talk to so he must need to vent a little bit I think it is good for him. But on the flip side I worry that having him talk about them to vent will only make them worse and stronger because when he vents about the effects his negative life situation + delusions he wants to give me context but to do so must elaborate, and I assume elaboration causes the delusions to become better thought out and more convincing.

So to make things less draining and scary every time I talk him I was thinking about outright telling him I don’t want to talk about whatever delusion that I have a decent understanding and don’t need him to talk more or when the delusion is just to big and scary and I worry talking about to will make it worse (I won’t say delusion because that would draw direct attention to it but I just will address the delusion and say I don’t want to talk about it). I assume this won’t work perfectly and he will try to continue especially if it’s very scary so I feel like if we drift back to talking about it I can tell him again I don’t want to talk about it to soften it maybe I could say I don’t want to talk about it but if it’s very important to you I can. I am ok with doing this but I want to know if this is too much of a push over thing to say that would result in him just always saying yes.

So tdlr; I am trying to help my little brother but I don’ know the right things to do. Also I am worried I’m hurting more than helping because I am scared I can only say yes to him (part of that is because I pity him because it’s so unbelievably unfair he’s suffering and I’m not. So I want to sacrifice things for my self because I don’t have it as bad as him and I want to make up for the fact that life is unfair) finally I would like some perspectives on this from people who have experience with delusions. How do you feel when people either tell you that something is a delusion or when you try to talk to someone about it and they tell you they don’t want to hear it. I want him to vent if he needs too but I also want to tell him no sometimes. So can I get some thoughts on what could happen when I outright call out a delusion for being one in response to a hidden camera/wires in wall delusion for example.",How would you feel if you were stressing over a delusion and trying to talk about it to someone and they said they didn’t want to talk about it?,[],r/schizophrenia,0.6739347389220144,-0.27735798211020646,-0.27735798211020646,0,1,1,0,0,Intelligent_Exit_737,-0.4203452324678521,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,21,0

schizophrenia,"So I’m currently struggling with unspecified psychosis that looks likely to be schizophrenia due to the fact I’ve had paranoia and delusions for many years now even prior to my recent hallucinations. 

One of my biggest struggles is that I’m completely isolated. I live with family and I basically don’t leave the house or have a single IRL friend other than some people I haven’t seen/met up with in around 5-10 years.

People and social interactions terrify me. When I used to socialise I would become paranoid that they’re laughing at me or just pretending to enjoy spending time with me. I felt afraid outside that I would be mugged or attacked. So now I just avoid leaving the house completely other than my therapy sessions and psychiatrist visits and a rare trip to the shop down the road.

I’m 31 and I feel like many of the best years of my life slipped away from me due to the isolation and I don’t want to stay this way.

Unfortunately my prescribed Risperidone has only made a small difference in this area, and I’m still so anxious around people that I even struggle to interact with my own family.

So I’m considering other options, one being trying out SSRIs or SNRIs. I’ve always been afraid of them because of their potential lasting side effects like PSSD, but I’m tired of living my life in a box and am willing to try anything at this point.

**So I was wondering, did anyone here try SSRIs or SNRIs or perhaps some other medication to try to treat your social difficulties, and did it help?**

I’m losing my mind with my sibling (36M) who was previously diagnosed with schizophrenia a few years ago when he was also involuntarily hospitalized after getting arrested. He stopped taking his medication for over a year now and has been in a psychotic episode for five months. He lives with our very old mother and she’s his caretaker. There’s no one else but us two, our mother and me, to handle this, no one else who can intervene or talk to him. We have begged for months that he takes his medicine and he refuses completely. In those months, he has displayed really worrying behavior but hasn’t been violent against a person, and he occasionally threatens with violence. He held knives toward us once (but we knew he wouldn’t hurt us), a cutter to delivery guys, and smashed appliances around the house. He is also posting worrying stuff online, mainly threats to kill or wishes of harm against public figures.

We tried non-invasive ways of encouraging him to take his medicine, like withholding pocket money, but he is finding ways around that, mainly getting credit and accumulating a lot of debt, and also using these threats of violence to try and get money from us.

He finally opened up about what he thinks is happening and he def has delusions of self-grandeur and persecution.

After his first involuntary hospitalization he was traumatized and very resentful. He doesn’t acknowledge his illness at all. He held us accountable for hospitalizing him and he threatened many times of self harm or harming us if we hospitalize him, including before the first time.
We’re not in the US or Europe and we send him to the best hospital where we live… I can’t find or afford better than it.

schizophrenia,"Hi all. I was diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar over a decade ago as a young adult. In my time reading people talk about the voices they hear, the typical voices seem to be purely coming from the self. Or towards the self in a very specific type of voice. For example Satan telling the person to cut themselves or that they're not worthy, etc.

I was wondering if anyone knows of a type of auditory hallucination where the person hears voices that feel purely external, like hearing the guy on the radio say ""I'm going to kill you \_\_(persons name)\_\_\_\_"", or hearing what sounds like a zoom call in another room where there are several different distinct voices chatting about how to go about killing \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. And going into great detail about methods, in an eerily realistic conversational way. Another case where you hear family members actually talking about getting rid of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_, then you walk around the corner into the living room to see them in person and everything seems totally normal.

It seems to me most of my auditory hallucinations have real people, or in some instances, perceived real people as the delivery method of the voices, though in reality it's the brain playing a trick. Is there a classification or any kind of information on this type of hallucination?

Title: Day 16 (Poetry) – Loaded or Empty – Schizophrenia 365
By: Steven Zilberg

—

It isn’t a lie, nor is it an exaggeration;

When you are best friends with the edge of the cliff,

Some days might feel as though you are walking through Anacostia Park;

Cherry Blossoms on both sides of you.

Other days may cause you to check the chamber and flick the safety off…

—

Now, I am not saying that the edge of the cliff is ‘the end of the line’,

If that is the case I think society might be confusing skylines with peacefully bowing out.

I can’t speak for everyone.

I can only speak for myself.

During the days I am able to plant sunflowers and hold garden snakes;

Despite sweat dripping down my forehead;

Laughing out loud, inappropriate jokes, and iced tea on a hot day are the memories worth holding onto.

—

Now, I ain’t a liar;

Nor am I going to beat around the bush.

During those days in which ‘the edge’ performs piano instrumentals,

It is fundamental society understands remedies are few and far between;

I ain’t saying I agree nor do I approve of sudden goodbyes and letters left for others to read,

All I am saying is that I understand why and how.

—

It does take a little bit of an imagination;

Folks like me that is something we got way too much of,

For the rest of you;

I don’t expect you to believe Moses separated the seas.

What do I expect of you is that you open your mind to the possibility that you and people like me walked out of the optical exam with different prescriptions.

—

I never claimed to be a painter or an illustrator,

We are going to use our imagination;

Bobby and Bill bought renaissance festival tickets for them and their little girl.

If you were observing them from afar they would seem to be a ‘normal family’.

Bobby and Bill might drink a little bit.

They read scripture and pray every night.

—

On opposite sides of the festival enters a group of friends.

All of them dressed up and ready to have fun.

One of these beautiful people is a 25 year old college student.

She choose to dress up as a Yennefer of Vengerberg,

This is where I ask for you to try on a new set of prescription glasses;

Despite her attending with friends,

Despite being reminded that she is loved and safe;

—

She witnesses everyone around her whispering,

She hears their conversations,

She is unable to decipher between multiverses,

Everyone around her is gossiping about her,

They all wear masks which shapeshift every hour,

She is touched by sorcery, spells, and charms,

Whenever she feels a tap on her shoulder and turns,

She sees nothing but strangers watching stage plays and laughing,

While she buys snacks, giant turkey legs, and beef jerky;

She is being commanded to run away, disappear, and slit her wrists.

She knows that she shouldn’t but it has been happening since turning 16.

—

Like I said before,

I am not saying that I agree but what I am claiming is that I understand why and how;

I have been in a similar position countless times.

Standing upon that edge;

Funny thing is that most people neglect the truth.

What do you think someone sees while looking down from the edge?

—

Do they see, hear, and feel an agonizing fire?

Do they see family members crying over their casket?

Do they hear the stories individual describe while dressed in black?

Do they hear the alternative options they have besides for taking hold of the cliff’s hand and saying goodbye?

—

This where new prescription glasses matter;

Whenever I have sat at the edge and looked down,

What I see and hear are peaceful musical notes,

What I see and hear are peaceful currents,

What I see and hear are less pain and less tears,

—

It isn’t a lie, nor is it an exaggeration;

When you are best friends with the edge of the cliff,

Some days might feel as though you are walking through Anacostia Park;

Cherry Blossoms on both sides of you.

Other days may cause you to check the chamber and flick the safety off…

schizophrenia,"I want to start this off by apologizing. I’m sure y’all get plenty of “I think I have/am developing schizophrenia” posts here, and I’m sure it’s annoying. I just want to hear about people’s real experiences. I am seeing a therapist with whom I am going to talk about these issues this week. 

Basically, a previous therapist suggested the possibility of me being in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Her reasons were mainly about my constant dissociation. I don’t fit the criteria for dissociative disorders, but even using grounding exercises, I never feel like I’m really here. It’s not a “who am I” sensation, just that I feel like I’m floating either above my body or a few inches inside, like I’m a miniature consciousness sitting inside my body that I feel almost no connection to. 

I’ve had bouts of paranoia. In childhood and still a couple times here and there, I feel like there are demons in my room, and if I don’t check to make sure they aren’t there, I worry I’ll be possessed in my sleep. I also had anxiety that—when my sister’s now-ex-boyfriend lived with us—he was hiding cameras in my room and watching me. The most recent one has been anxiety that the guy I was talking to about 2 years ago is going to use our texts (which were sometimes sexual) against me. I’ve also worried that people can read my mind or that my dead relatives are watching me, but I think that’s a result of growing up religious lol. Recently I’ve been having “gut feelings” that I’m going to die soon, but it doesn’t feel like anxiety. Idk if that is necessary to add, but just in case. 

Another consistent issue I’ve dealt with is lack of feeling. I haven’t felt joy or enjoyment doing something in years. At most, it’s like, “Oh, I’d rather play video games than do absolutely nothing,” but I don’t feel enjoyment. I’ve been described as robotic at times. I have had many instances (like today) when I feel “flat.” I’m moving slowly and talking slowly, but I don’t feel depressed. 

I don’t know. I’m asking bc it’s been on my mind again, and sometimes I wonder if the reason that my depression is treatment-resistant (as diagnosed by my psychiatrist) is because I have something more going on. If y’all have any advice or experience with anything I mentioned, I’d appreciate the info. And again, I’m sorry for posting here.

schizophrenia,"So I have a neurotypical friend who did some ""research"" into smoking weed, and I don't smoke anymore, but he smokes real heavy, and he told me how smoking weed can cause schizophrenia.  

I politely explained to him that what causes schizophrenia is an extreme stressor, generally long term stress that lasts for a while, and only if you have a predisposition to it. I also explained that for certain people that stress threshhold is higher than others. Such as a military veteran, of which the population has a higher schizophrenic percentage, sees much more stress than the average civilian, therefore their population is more likely to develop schizophrenia.

And yet, every time I explain this to a neurotypical they're always like ""oH tHaTs nOt RiGhT..."" which fucking pisses me off, like the fucking audacity to act like, you, a neurotypical, who doesn' talk to schizos on a regular basis, has any idea what you're talking about.

schizophrenia,"I'm not asking for a diagnosis or psychiatric advice, just a suggestions to help me understand better.

Since I was younger I've had what feels to me as consistent psychosis with short breaks in between (I can't remember the exact age but I remember having them more than not). The ones I remember were believing people could hear my thoughts, dreams potentially accessed in the future so I couldn't dream, sound and video recording of me in my room, believing everyone around me was fake (this was a repeated one where I believed I was either in some form of hell/simulation where I was the only conscious being \[this stayed with me a worrying amount of time\]), the most recent and terrifying one was believing the house across the road was recording me. In the final one I even spoke to my mom about seeing someone wear a mask in the window and staring at me for hours, I believed I saw a red little light from someone's window that turned off whenever I looked through my window. This resulted in me keeping my blinds shut for months and living in complete darkness, I even attempted to record them to have evidence, often it kept me up late at night looking through a gap in my blind. This final one was around 3-4 years ago (my memory is incredibly foggy) and I haven't had any others since.

When I looked into the schizophrenia and psychosis a year or two after the final one it felt surreal that I could have these ideas and questioned if I'd even know if they were fake if I really had experienced psychosis. When I began looking into it, this was at a time when I was going through the process of getting an autism diagnosis; I have now been diagnosed with both Autism and ADHD including flags for generalised anxiety and depression. So now, I question whether these experiences were real or conjured from an imagination.

&amp;#x200B;

Firstly, I believe they started before the age of 12 (although as previously mentioned I have very foggy memory), as I have read it appears to be abnormal to begin having such events at that age. Secondly, Autism and Schizophrenia comorbidity is very rare to my knowledge and seems unlikely. Thirdly, from my memory, psychosis occurs due to an excess of dopamine, this is contradictory to ADHD as I would of had significantly lower dopamine. Overall, my age and lack of recent events makes me skeptical of my past experiences, I struggle to tell if they are even real when writing - I know I experienced those things and believed them to be real but was it just childlike behabiour; and, why now have I stopped having any events when on ADHD meds which should hypothetically mean I experience psychosis if I infact had something of the sort.

schizophrenia,"Hi so I have schizoaffective disorder bipolar type. I really don't feel very well at the moment. My thoughts became very dark a couple of months ago and I started minorly hallucinating visualy. Upped my meds to max dose and I think I am unwell again. I am hearing voices inside my head that are not my voice they tell me they are demons and they chant 666 ,kill yourself, your nothing, they are all watching you, hahahahahaha etc. They are telling me to hurt people violently and I am scared. I've been having horrible thoughts recently that I'm sure are not my own too. This stuff disturbs me big time. It makes me worry if I am a psychopath but when i am more well i am not violent at all quite the opposite i like to think im very kind.

I have been carrying a small knife for my protection and sleeping with a knife under my pillow. Im having visual flashes of me violently killing people and im dreaming about it too. This is really disturbing me. I feel really paranoid that people are coming to kill me and my partner and my dogs. I can't stop listening to devil music and drawing weird devilish things. I am really worried that something is going to happen and I will kill someone and be put in prison for the rest of my life or a secure unit. I do NOT want to hurt anyone or cause anyone any harm but I have a weird outside force telling me that I need to do it.

I forgot how to pull away on the clutch in my car earlier and this was the last straw. I have decided its time to give up driving for the meantime now.

I feel like I'm losing my mind more and more each day. I keep completely forgetting what I'm saying mid conversation aswell. This happens 5 times minimum a day. I will literally be explaining something to someone or telling a story and ill just completely forget what I was talking about. I do this with things I'm doing too I forget what I'm doing or get distracted. 

I have been baking 5 loaves of different bread a day and I've watched the same programme 150 times now ( i say watched but just listened too). Because I can't concentrate on anything. 

I am not washing properly, maybe once or twice a week and I'm not eating. Maybe once a day with my meds and half a sandwich or something when I do.

schizophrenia,"hi, guys! i’ve struggled with psychosis a few times in my life but this is one of the first times i’m seeing it in someone else. it’s an extremely long story but my boyfriend believes people from the place he worked 2 years ago (call it workplace A) where he had a very deep conversation and lost time from are talking to other people at his current workplace. when he first talked to them he couldn’t stop talking about it for a few months and he said he predicted things that have happened now and about how great the conversation was. he said his boss was on the phone with other people when it happened but he didn’t know who. at one point he had some kind of revenge plan about someone in upper management where he used to work because he thought they were involved and he says they called him slurs. he changed locations and got fired for problems he was having with another coworker. he said the coworker was put up to harassing him basically. 

then he started at workplace B where he had a hotel room paid for by the company and he thought there were cameras in the room and that everyone thought he was on drugs because he is prescribed adderall. he thought people from workplace B were also connected to workplace A and that management from workplace A used to work at workplace B. he quit there because he hated it. 

now he thinks people from workplace A and B and at his new job C are talking about him and talked to his doctor (who is my mom’s boss) to change his medication and that people from there also called me and i talked to them. he got a new job at workplace C driving food deliveries and he seemed happy for a few weeks. he overshared at his interview which he has done everywhere he worked. but now he thinks people from workplace C are also out to get him and know what happened at workplace A/ were there on the phone call. 

there’s a lot more i can’t remember but the point is yesterday he called his sister explaining all this because he thought a specific woman he is having problems with knows his sister. his sister obviously thought something was wrong and didn’t believe him and was talking to him about mental acuity and told him to see his doctor as an emergency appointment. he talked on the phone to his doctor and got a referral to a neurologist. except he only talked to his doctor about possibly having autism because he has been saying he has autism and at one point thought he was diagnosed but i told him a family doctor cannot diagnose him with autism. ive been telling him to be completely honest and talk about everything from his first workplace to now. hopefully even if he wasnt going there for symptoms of psychosis, with this whole story; a neurologist wouldnt miss it. 

a month ago i wrote this whole letter trying to talk to him about his paranoia because he thought i was on the phone call 2 years ago and that my mom was also on the phone call. because supposedly when he came home that day we were sitting on the couch and he felt like we were staring. i told him i talk to my mom sometimes and it has nothing to do with him and that me and my mom sharing the couch isnt that weird. 

now when he was eating breakfast he said i was having secret phone calls months ago talking about him. he thinks people are trying to learn really private inappropriate things about him. i told him i didnt talk to anyone about him and that im really worried he might be going through psychosis and he got up and left and went on a walk. i just want to know if anyone has had similar experiences on either end and what i can do to be there for him while not reinforcing his delusions? he doesnt seem to understand why i get upset when he is making accusations about me or people i know.

schizophrenia,"I am a feminine bodied person. I have mentioned all this to a therapist. This is an organized way for me to potentially present what I go through to the feminine body gaurdian I lived with.

I lived in a family where the feminine bodied guardian did all the work, and the masculine body guardian stayed at home (non-working, unsure of status now).

when I was younger, I would experience non-consensual visuals, where my masculine body guardian was having sex with me. Even in the visuals it was very clear that I was uncomfortable with what was going on and the masculine body parent would be aware that I was uncomfortable in the visuals and still continue.

some of the visuals I would experience when I was younger, was me being in a ring with young, feminine bodied, people, and men and dark burgundy, maroon brown coats would be having sex with the children, and I was one of those children. this was before I knew about sex, orgies, or sex rings. I started to have visuals of me in a room with different bed and the masculine bodied gaurdian I grew up with was raping me.

when I went to college, I started noticing that right when I was about to orgasm, the visual would come up of the masculine bodied gaurdian, and he would take all of the energy that was released from my orgasm. I did send a text to the masculine body guardian, telling him to stop taking my sexual energy.

Today I had a dream that the masculine body gaurdian transformed into another masculine bodied form, and had sex with me, and then avoided me at all costs. It was only after I woke up that I realize that the boy that I had been chasing in my dream and then ignored me, was my masculine bodied gaurdian.

even after I woke up, I did a bit of moving the energy by taking my hands and physically removing the places where I can feel the masculine body gaurdians energy. Yesterday I could smell the masculine body guardian when I was awake and I thought about how non-consensual it felt to be able to smell my masculine body guardian because I do not want to interact with my masculine bodied guardian on air through waves.

Anyone experience anything similar with gaurdians or sibilings?

I’m not sure if it can be connoted to psychotic disorders (then again I’m not neccessarily emotionally invested in the labels, i would like to hear experiences instead because i feel alone and I’m a frequent poster here, on other subs i wasn’t even allowed to post this)

It really sucks, bc it’s like i feel everything as if i was experiencing it 5 fold, but at the same time, i dont understand it and my empathy is limited to feeling, i cannot care, only feel like i re-live trauma but I’m not really interested, mostly bc of how much distress it makes me feel

its like you tell me someone died, i would probably feel anxious if you talk about it long enough but i will still not really care. i had some major empathy errors in my life, often when something bad happened to other people or someone got in front of my own needs, i always think about myself, i dont really know what is it like to care without having intense physical pain from it. I either would give my life for someone or not care at all and not much in between, even that turns on and off so suddenly i stop or start caring

the day before yesterday my best friend was in tears from physical pain and i didnt understand her cue that was politely telling me that she can’t talk right now, i couldnt understand why would she be so upset, i simoly didnt have the ability, same with everything else, but if it’s not my best friend then most of the personal distress is gone, i simply dont feel moved unless I’m manipulated into it by the WAY the story is told, last time my friend had an autistic meltdown bc of not getting ice cream (we are 19 and 21(me)) and it felt worse than when i hear news of someones passing, i felt absolutely in despair what to do and as i saw her getting more and more involved i kind of broke to pieces as well, it felt like someone was shouting at me

i wake up and my first thought “you dont deserve to live you emotionless worthless monstér / error”

i would think “alright, anyways that sucks but it’s not my problem, I refuse to talk about topics that bother me”

schizophrenia,"In 2018 I started hearing things, mainly whispering. I thought I was going crazy so I saw psych who said I had drug induced psychosis from smoking weed. Over a year I tried 5 different antipsychotics, none of which helped.

In 2019 I took Abilify that gave me really bad unintentional movements, my arm leg etc would randomly kick or punch. Would happen 100s of times a day. Got better over a year but still sometimes to this day my head jerks back and blink really hard, or my eyelids close and then flutter for a second. But I think what caused it is that the same kind of thing had been going on with me since I was a kid, when id close my eyes I sometimes start to blink rapidly, its like that now just way way worse.

I saw a neurologist who said medication doesn't work for the type I have, said I have eyelid myoclonia. He asked me about my driver's license 3 times during the appointment and said he didn't want me to get an EEG cause I'd instantly lose it if failed.

I haven't seen any psych or neuro for a long time since then. The hearing things is way better. I think I was paying attention to them too much, it always seems to happen if I listen for it. Most of the time it isn't even voices, usually it's music or sound effects.

I've had a lot of family deaths recently, lostmyjob etc. went and saw a psychiatrist last month. She thinks I probably have epilepsy though and doesn't want to give me anything that might make it worse. She said she's gonna try n talk to the neuro I saw but I really don't want to look too much into it because they have very strict laws about driving with epilepsy where I live.

schizophrenia,"My partner told me yesterday when I was beating myself up that I need to accept the reality that I'm disabled. 

I was basically telling her that I was supposed to be something great, I was an A+ student before all of this hit and was in my second year of college (had to drop out), I wanted to be in the medical field... now I just feel stupid and useless and so DUMB, like my brain just feels so intolerably dumb. I still have the want to be in the medical field, but my partner says it's an unrealistic standard and that I need to change my goal to something more achievable. I did have one other dream, to write fiction novels, but I don't know if I could ever follow through on that or if I would be successful. 

I can't work because it's too stressful, I can barely go to the grocery store or a doctor's appointment without being overwhelmed the rest of the day. I can barely do hobbies like play video games or draw because I get frustrated. I also have depression and severe anxiety. (Technically I am Schizoaffective Bipolar Type but I haven't had any hypomania in a long time so I think I'm depressive type). I can't even keep my house clean, and if it gets too dirty I can't clean it because I get too overwhelmed by all the stuff. You can probably see how this wouldn't go too well in a work environment. I had 2 jobs in the past, but didn't work long enough to get SSDI so I'm waiting on SSI (specifically for someone in the department to get put on my case, I got past the initial stuff but I've been waiting 6 months so far).

Anyways, I'm getting off topic. How do I accept that I can likely never achieve the high standards I have set for myself? That I was supposed to do great things in life and be successful, and I'm not what I imagined I would be? How do I stop beating myself up for being a ""loser"" with no job and no life?

My positive symptoms are in check with meds, but the anxiety is severe and hasn't been helped by anything and the depression sucks, plus I still have some negative symptoms (which there is no meds for). So I'm ""stable,"" but not stable enough to ever do what I want to in life. I'm in therapy.

Guess I'm just depressed that my life didn't turn out like I dreamed for it to be, and can't accept that I'm disabled.

schizophrenia,"(TLDR down below)

Hello all,
New person here, not diagnosed or evaluated for schizophrenia. Looking for advice on my present predicament which is as follows...

Back in 2020 I got diagnosed with depression, CPTSD, and ADHD. I started taking buproprion(atypical antidepressant with stimulant properties) which did wonders for my adhd and depression, not so much for my anxiety. 
I took it for 2.5 years and in doing so the following happened:
1. I drank on it multiple times.
2. I combined it with concentrated THC 🍃 multiple times.
3. My seizures threshold got lowered as indicated on the bottle by buproprion.
4. I started having seizures from combing the above mentioned drugs.
5. Through therapy, conversations, evaluation found out I've had small episodes of derealization/depersonalization at a very early age alongside auditory hallucinations in very early childhood(2-3 years old) from pneumonia/codeine/etc.
6. I didn't tell my doctor out of fear of losing the only antidepressant that worked for me, SSRIs made me incredibly ill. 
5. had about 20 seizures over the course of 2.5 years 
6. Came off of everything last year in sequential self imposed cold turkey sessions..

Up until about 6 months ago I had 0 concern for my wellbeing/existence, I've since found my own meaning/purpose for myself to pursue, and alongside it I've started having an unexpected side effect from all the recent drug abuse, withdrawal, therapy, and practices.

Occasionally when I relax my brain and decompress from anxiety, I have 2nd person auditory verbal hallucinations, and they have slowly progressed from single words to short sentences..

They're not violent or mean, but they do surprise me at first.
At times it feels like another person talking, and it happens in my dreams now as well.

My question(s) after all that, is how can I lean into this a bit more and see where this goes ? 
Is that a bad idea ?
Is there something else I should look out for ?
Does anyone have advice for how I might be able to bring this more to the front of my attention and have some agency over it ?

Currently I take 0 medication, and intend to continue the status quo.

TLDR - I messed up my brain with prescribed medication and unprescribed medication, 20 seizures and 3 years later I now have verbal hallucinations and I feel like I have another person talking in my head, therapist knows, and I want to push the dial a little, anyone know something I could try to lean into these hallucinations a little more?",Seeking opinions/advice.,[],r/schizophrenia,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,99Spectres,-0.48776958685523125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,11,2

I could swear they are invading my mind now in my sleep, not when I am awake anymore,  
but when I can't remember what they are doing when I am asleep.   
I am having this theory since my first voices and despite my medication.

schizophrenia,"Hello, I was recently diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia after a two month hospitalization. I have never had this diagnosis before.

Some of the features of what I experience has been characterized as 'rigid thinking,' disorganized thinking, delusions etc.

I have also struggled with splitting, but thankfully that improved significantly while in the hospital.

I would appreciate feedback on a couple of issues:

1) I have rigid thinking and sometimes struggle with integrating different parts of myself - I experience my different modes as very different but still the same person. Can anyone relate to this experience?

2) I daydream very regularly and sometimes struggle to discern when my mind is experiencing reality.

3) I very suddenly lost interest in many things, and I'm not sure why or what to do about it.

Does anything I'm saying speak to anyone? I feel isolated by my experiences sometimes.

schizophrenia,"So I’ve been diagnosed with Schizophrenia for a couple of months now. We never knew much about it and we still don’t. The psychologist basically told us that I had it, suggested I take medication, and then left. He never actually told me anything about it so all the things I know are because of my own research. Anyways my parents always knew something was wrong with me ever since I was eleven through twelve. It started to get worse around the end of me being fifteen and turning sixteen. I would have breakdowns for no reason, be extremely paranoid, I would do things I couldn’t explain but I thought would keep me from dying or I was so set on believing something that nobody could convince me otherwise. I've struggled a lot with delusions and paranoia. but recently it's been getting worse even with my medication. I'm laying awake at night, feeling like spiders are in my skin, I'm paranoid the tv is going to turn on and scary images are going to show, and probably the worst thing, every time I try to close my eyes I see flashing images of scary disfigured faces. Sometimes I even see these faces when I open my eyes and I feel like the only thing I can do is hide under the covers and hope it goes away. I can't tell if this is a schizophrenic thing or something else, but it's affecting me so much I’m starting to lose sleep, I'm not focusing on my school, and I'm eating less.

schizophrenia,"Hi all,

My family member (25M) was diagnosed with schizophrenia about 4 years ago. I want to help him as he is starting to enter a state of psychosis. This has lead to him unfortunately putting himself in not so great situations (he was jumped by 5 guys last week) his reasoning was this group of people looked like good people so the stars told him to follow them.

When he is in this state he starts to just go on long (and dangerous) walks. I have attempted calls to crisis services and he also had an appointment with his psychiatrist whom says nothing is wrong. I fail to understand how the psychiatrist is unable to see but I guess that it is a given as they don’t spend nearly as much time with him as I do.

I wanted to know if there’s anything that calms someone down when they’re in this state, I know there is no convincing him what he believes isn’t real, others have tried. I believe that he believes these very specific things and I won’t dispute it with him. (Government poisoning, UFOS talking to him, stars talking to him) 

He has now entered a state where he refuses to eat, and paces the house while blaring music in his headphones very very loudly.

Since professional help deems him a safe member of society with no plans for admission, is there anything I can do to help?

Also, I want to apologize in advance for my ignorance to this condition, I can’t possibly understand what he or anyone else is going through, just want to help.

I developed a weird obsessional crush on a coworker and made up a strange scenario and believed it after being rejected. I have issues with rejection and abandonment and I grew up isolated. I have adhd and autism. Got seveare anxiety and depression but it comes and goes and sometimes I take my meds. Anyways I have had some strange breakdowns. One where I thought my friends were talking about me years ago. It is unclear if they were or not.  And one where I was paranoid about one talking behind my back and I often listen by his door. Anyways fast forward I have hypochondriac like issue where I convince myself I’m sometimes dying with google. Most of the times I have symptoms but not I’m afraid they are real. I started dating my bf. Got back on antipsychotics. I was misdiagnosed with bipolar  when I smoked. I developed acute dystonia and had to suddenly stop. I got very paranoid about my relationship. We have issues of course anyways I was triggered by finding my friends underwear and I completely lost it. I have bits of clarity but on bad nights she stay over I would check the locks and think she’s in bathroom with him. I thought I saw her shadow in a video he once sent and saw a text from her  during all of this. All of which after I was able to clearly realize wasn’t true. Most at night or when I drank. I was going through the worst stress of my life. My doctors say it’s anxiety and autism but I can’t get over it. I look up symptoms and convinced I am developing it. My dad is bipolar and my family has lots of mental health issues anxiety being extreme. I had therapist tell me I was developing schizophrenia to the point I when I spiral I google and freak out and don’t leave my house. Once lasted a month. I’ve had fears like this with cancer and Lyme disease but knowing everything I know… I’m fucked… I wish I never touched weed. Im about to turn 25 when it shows up. I know I can’t prevent it if I were to develop it. But I feel so hopeless. Is there a chance my doctors are right and it’s just extreme anxiety and stress? If I have delusions or hallucinations they are non bizarre and often misterpretations. Anyone else experience something similar? Btw it’s been like 5 years length of this all happening.

The senses of sound and vision and your muscle movements all send there signal to the balance system.

Does the human tailbone still wag? For the past 5 years I have been watching for it.

You can stimulate your tailbone to wag by wobbling your knee slightly for a second, stop it abruptly, and then watch for your tail to start wagging.

A wagging tail used to lead me down schizophrenic rabbit holes because it would make me dizzy while sitting still and I would associate it with voices.

Other wobbling, dizzy type visual hallucinations can come from: the center of the forehead, inner ear on either side, the vision of either eye, your musculoskeletal system, breathing.

Nervous gestures like crinkling a piece of paper in your pocket or twitching, movements that aren't accomplishing anything, those made while waiting, one makes these gestures in response to the tailbone and stifling its wobbling effects.

A natural tailbone wag occurs when you release adrenaline. Your size and any animals size controls how and when you get excited. Adrenaline can be a happy excitement or a fight or flight response. Adrenaline flight response is anxiety.

One useful trick to observe control over dizzy visual hallucinations is: stare at something for a good couple seconds, then turn your attention in your vision to something in your peripherals, after a second it may begin to wobble. You can move the wobbling around between objects by changing your minds attention to different objects in your vision. Focusing on nothing will make your whole vision wobble.

Basically have to be a perfect servant and give up my free will. I feel the presence of someone in my body basically moving my eyes and hands. I cant even read or look at the computer screen because my eyes will skip around to look at different words as if I am being given a message.

I really don't know what to do. It's been 3 years. Whenever I do a ""sinful behavior"" I feel agony in my chest (like I'm being crucified.) It's so real I feel like I'm being stabbed in the chest.

schizophrenia,"This is a lot of rambling just to warn.

Last night was one of my worst sleeps, and yesterday thus had some of my worst cognitive and negative symptoms. I was just absolutely fucked. I was hoping for tonight to be different, but roommates messed with the thermostat again, woke to a 90 degree room out of a dead sleep after an hour and a half of struggling to sleep. I don't know how long I would've slept if I hadn't been woken up, but it was a damn good sleep. I'm old enough to know my body at this point; it would've been at least 3 hours. I got 3 hours last night. 

I don't know how I'm so capable of thinking right now. Likely because I'm so fucking wired from being triggered because my partner and I have explained again and again to these fuckwads, you turn the heat above 70 and our bedroom gets fucking unlivable, and we both are heat sensitive as hell. Literally over 90 degrees before the heat fucking shuts off, I'd sweat through my pajamas and my blanket was fucking soaked. At this point, I'm not even sure if me thinking our roommates wanna kill me is a fucking delusion or if they are. Disclaimer, it's uh probably a delusion. Idk, I'm also trans and they're kinda really against that, so it's hard to tell lmao I wonder why my paranoia keeps getting worse!!! I wonder!!! I fucking wonder!!! I don't want to talk about ""why I don't leave"" btw, I'm ignoring everyone that asks that even if you have other stuff in your comment. Don't ask that. Thinking about it will literally trigger me when I've finally started calming down, don't ask why I haven't left. 

I just want to sleep. I have literal trauma surrounding sleep aids but I'm desperate enough to try them again after 15 years. I'm already paranoid as hell (my worst positive symptom), I don't wanna think about my hallucinations really starting up again. The visual ones are manageable. The tactile ones, I'm literally terrified of getting those back bad again. It's always bugs. The visual ones are usually bugs now that I think about it actually. And I actually have yet to identify IF I get delusions. Which means I'm probably just unaware honestly, I was unaware of my hallucinations being hallucinations for 20 goddamn years. I wanna sleep. I'm so fucking tired. And I'm so fucking angry right now. I've calmed down from the initial adrenaline rush but I can tell I'm still absolutely fucking wired. I'm really good at waiting it out but can it stop faster? Or maybe it's the only reason I can think right now. 

I should play a game. Or listen to music. But they're Wrong right now. I swear to god dealing with my brain's own hypocrisy is going to give me a fucking ulcer or something if I don't already have one. And I don't mean I'm lacking energy or enjoyment, I don't think I am right now. I'm just so fucking pissed off. I can't imagine music or a game right now, I'm just so fucking pissed off. And it feels kinda good. I've tried keeping myself quiet and ""calm"" and a fucking doormat for so goddamn fukcing long, it feels good. I'm also very fucking triggered, this is a symptom, and it's not a good one! But once this wears off, I probably won't be able to think or concentrate. I can already kinda feel it. It's terrifying, it's like I'm not even alive. It's coming on fast though, as I type this. I gusss I'm calming down whether I want to or not.

Calm is the reason I started writing this though. I'd still rather be calm and barely alive/thinking than pissed off like that.

I know psychotic symptoms are more frequent when alone for more people. I have this too, but not always. While having a lot of social interaction and being alone afterwards is a sure-fire way to experience psychotic symptoms.

schizophrenia,"On my medical charts it says I have schizophrenia but it feels weird having that label when I’m not even sure I actually have it.

Below are the details of the psychosis but it’s long so feel free to skip that part/section, but I put it in case it could be useful. I’m not looking for medical advice so hopefully this doesn’t get removed but just want to hear perspectives and opinions from people who actually have schizophrenia. 

Back in 2021 I was under an insane amount of stress and psychosis came on out of nowhere one day during work. I had no idea what day of the week it was (someone told me it was a Friday, and I would never forget if it was Friday ever) and I just felt vaguely confused all day. Got in my car and read an article about Huntingtons disease (a progressive disease sort of like parkinsons or dementia) and was convinced that I had it and that my entire family knew but never told me. I was convinced my best friend was hired by my family because they knew I was going to die and needed a good friend. I called a bunch of family members accusing them of this and then they took me to a crisis center where my delusion rapidly changed to thinking I was being punished for something I did in a past life or that this was all a police set up my family helped with and that I was going to jail. I eventually started to think I was dead and in hell (like that my entire life has actually been disguised as real but was really hell and that I did something terrible when I was alive on earth but no memory of that life). I started to think they were going to deprive me of water as torture so I grabbed hand sanitizer and drank it then I walked out of the building on to the side of the street and the police quickly came and had me involuntarily committed. They had me wait in an ER room before being transferred to get things in order with the door open and a “sitter” outside. People were walking by the door mocking me or repeating things I’ve said to people before in the past. And when the TV was turned on all the commercials looked like they were from the 90s (even a chipotle commercial which wasn’t around then) and the people on the news were speaking gibberish. I now realize that those were hallucinations. I thought those were the only time but days later my doctor wrote in my notes (which I saw when I got out on my online portal) that I denied having hallucinations but she noted that I was “clearly preoccupied with something external” and my eyes would rapidly dart around the room. She also said I would start saying a sentence but get lost and not finish them. There was an event where I asked if I could touch a nurse’s eyelashes and tried to grab her rounds binder out of her hands. I literally have no memory of this but it’s in my notes. Things started to feel more “normal” each day and I was released after 2 weeks once my family was on board. When I left I questioned if things were just back to “fake normal” again and if I was still in hell or a simulation because everything that happened felt so real and fucked up. 

Back to today. I’ve been mostly okay since then- no hallucinations, no hearing things, no actual full on psychosis. My problem is I think I still have paranoia but not sure if that is the accurate term. Like for example, I often wonder if my professor just pretends very well to like me but actually hates me and is constantly analyzing my every move and testing to see how I would respond to certain questions. Or I will wonder if my aunts texts have some underlying meaning or that she is being passive aggressive. Things like that. But could that just be overthinking/anxiety related considering it’s just me contemplating if it’s true rather than downright believing it is?

I belong to a schizoaffective support group on Facebook and people always post about having hallucinations daily for years and that it’s just an every day thing for them. I can’t relate to any of them since mine only occurred during psychosis which was only once years ago.

schizophrenia,"I haven't showered or brushed my teeth in at least three weeks. Possibly more than a month. I'm not sure.

I've had problems in the past with being unable to get in the shower or unable to leave the shower due to hallucinations / anxiety.

This is a stupid, embarrassing question, but do any of you have suggestions on how to get myself back on track with my personal hygiene? I don't understand what the problem is and I'm not sure how to solve it. I think part of it has to do with a pervasive sense of being unsafe in my apartment, and part of it may have to do with a shoulder injury I need to see my doctor about. 

I did change my clothes today, so that's a win.

My therapist and psychiatrist are both aware of the issue, but offered no solutions. They both basically said ""well call the crisis line if you need to, bye"". I don't think this is a crisis that requires strangers to come to my house and try to talk me through it, and I don't really think that would help at all.

I've already read through several related posts, some of which were helpful, but I'm looking for actionable solutions that don't require me to first go to the store. Although I might wind up doing that anyways if I can't convince myself to shower before like 2pm.

Right now I'm telling myself that if I shower and trim my nails, I'll get to paint them, which would be smth nice to do for myself. And after reading through related posts I'm considering cutting my hair again, although it's already fairly short, to minimize the amount of care it needs. I'm also considering taking some as-needed antianxiety meds and allowing myself to nap afterwards if necessary, but I hate the thought of a simple shower taking all day.

bipolar,"[*posted again to remove a link*]  

Hi, what advice do you wish you knew early on in your treatment/diagnosis of BD? I'm open to hearing anything. But given my circumstances, I'm especially interested in mitigating the pain that BD often inflicts on SO's, friends, family, etc. Any constructive advice/criticism is welcome.

### Backstory  
I'm a 30'sM with diagnosed&amp;medicated BD2. I'm only 3 months into diagnosis, still finding meds (Lithium+Depakote) that work for me, maintaining a high level of work/life/social/therapy/personal wellbeing, and am in the process of attempting reconcilliation with my (living apart) ex-fiance. I'm far from great, but considering the number of rock bottoms in my life, I'm doing well.

My symptoms started strongly expressing after both of my parents died days apart in 2020 (not COVID related). Up until then, I could communicate and perceive reality clearly. I'm a recovering addict who had a decade under his belt before rocketing towardsvtgis new flavor of hypomanic/mixed episode. While I was still my loving and goofy self, I started gaslighting my ex when she would understandably express concern. That turned into further detachment from trusting others, and both manipulating and controlling people and situations. I then took on my parents' estates w/o lawyers (didn't need to), and was fueled by a great deal of shame and trauma. This ""valid"" obsession allowed me to get away with a lot while grieving, and few others could see how different I had become. I was high functioining until I wasn't.

Around the time of closing each estate's probate case, I placed my hypomanic energy into a fear of abandonment that drove me to curate relationships, both platonic and one romantic for a childhood friend, to help me navigate my new unhinged version of reality. While I expressed love in countless healthy ways, I was also absent for my ex in ways that truly mattered as she navigated her own grief and traumas. I started fantasizing about ""ideal"" realities to help me cope with feeling unsafe in my own body.

Finally, after an array of triggers stacked a year ago - flu, rsv, covid, long covid, being alone, grief, and normal holiday anxiety - I allowed my other reality all the footing and outwardly expressed ""love"" to someone else on the phone. I thought that once she didn't reciprocate, then we could go back to friendship. She had become like a ""mom surrogate"" and we had been trauma bonded since childhood. To my surprise in that reality, no, friendship was not safe for her, and we stopped talking.

Months later, I told my ex the partial truth about the other woman, and denied the rest. Instead of saying I thought I loved her, I told her the closest truth I actually believed: I only had ""feelings"" for my friend. I didn't say the ""love"" had faded along with a hypomanic state. I didn't understand what BD, hypomania, mixed episode, or any of what I was experiencing actually was. Had I known then maybe something could have gone differently. All I knew for certain in my reality was: **they will all leave me if they know I don't understand myself anymore.**

After the facts of the emotional affair came out, my ex left me within the week. I became suicidal, obsessive, confused about my old therapist saying I definitely don't have bipolar, left that therapist, did a codepency retreat, joined 12 Step SLAA for love addiction, found a psychiatrist, got diagnosed ADHD, left psychiatrist as he was a dick, and **finally** found a psychiatrist + therapist that I can trust all of myself with, and was formally diagnosed and treated for BD2 😌  I would not be alive without my care team.

Now, my ex and I are in the process of a full disclosure to give her everything she needs to heal from the emotional affair, and hopefully process some of the pain of almost marrying someone who wasn't aware of their own BD (i.e. provide her moments in the relationship where BD took the wheel and gaslit, manipulated, or was cruel to her). There's no promise to reconcile, but it's the necessary first step.

It's been a very, very intense week as the holidays are primed to find all the cracks in my BD treatment plan, and introduce brand new triggers. lol thanks Santa 🎁. Even with a decade of therapy and success with some meds, I still find myself disappointing and hurting her even with the best of intentions + planning (e.g. communication blunders on both ends, oversharing, expecting too much too soon, etc.). I have a CSAT therapist for the emotional affair work, and one for BD2/ADHD. Meds and therapy are life saving and I'm improving. My shame is shifting towards more acceptance more often than not (well, except during trigger week... er, I mean ""the holidays"" 🫠).

But, I'm soberly aware that if I keep up at even this rate of healing, there will be no option for reconciliation. Even though it breaks my heart to imagine a lifetime without her, I can't blame her if the day-to-day of a BD2 SO would not be worth it for her (especially after my betrayal). Or, she just doesn't have that level of commitment to provide me/us given her own trauma history that she'll be unpacking for years to come. It's been promising to hear her talk about reading so much on bipolar, and asking questions and trying to make plans about what the relationship would look like given both of our needs. I pray there's hope for us but I see clearly how much I am asking of her to not only trust me again, but to trust that a relationship with a BD2 partner (even) in treatment could be safe and lead to a fulfilling life for her+me.

I have to make sure I don't unnecessarily hurt her or myself further because of manageable elements of BD2.

I am 26 years old, live in Germany and finished my studies this year. Before that I trained as a carpenter and worked in the furniture industry for a long time. Also as a salesman. 

After 4 years of therapy and Lamotrigine, I am finally stable. The diagnosis of BP2 was tough and the time with corona was not easy. 

I pulled through and now work as an Inside Sales Account Manager. 

I'm earning well and can slowly start to have a private life again. I'm even dating right now! 

I can actually be proud of myself. 

If it wasn't for my family... 

My mum is also struggling with mental health problems. The last thing she said to me was ""I wish I'd aborted you"" 

My stepfather was always aggressive towards me, beatings and insults were normal. 

Of course, I no longer have any contact with them. 

The last time I saw my father was in the spring. He hasn't asked if I've passed or if or what I'm doing now. 

On Wednesday I asked my stepmother if and when we would see each other for Christmas. 

Until now we've always met on the 24th. 

The only answer I got back was ""Why are you asking?"" 

I replied ""because it's Christmas and I'd like to see you"" 

No answer...

Now I'm sitting at home alone today, making myself a goulash, drinking some red wine and going to play. 

My only fear?

To be alone with my thoughts. 

And only because today is Christmas. 

It doesn't even play a role in my life. If today were any other day, I'd be more relaxed... 

Tomorrow I'm meeting my grandma, she's worried about me today... 

And I'm sitting here with my brain spinning irrational thoughts. 

Head ""You're alone!"" 

Me"" That's not true, I have people around me who like me ""

Head"" Nobody likes you""

Me"" that's not true""

Head ""Why do you even want to spend time with other people? They only hurt you, don't they? ""

Me"" Shut up, I have great friends and a granny who worries about me. I'm currently getting to know people who are interested in me and who I like. ""

bipolar,"Caveat: still on my meds. 

Every time I get stressed out or tired or busy or emotional or horny or feel anything basically, I get sad because it’s number now. I used to feel things so deeply! I wrote loads of weird stuff about it! I felt a deep kinship with Byron and Shelley and Coleridge and all the other genius writers “touched with fire”.. 

But now sure I write. 100k people have read what I write (this is not a delusion of grandeur! This is true!). But it’s not really the same. Used to be able to write as easily and automatically as breathing and now I have to think about it. I don’t like thinking about it. Even at school I never bothered planning anything with my essays, I just wrote, and I got full marks. I see people saying that meds stifling creativity is a myth, but I’m not so sure. I’m on lamotrigine and I’ve seen a Lot of chat here about word recall. I also can’t think of rhymes as easily! Half my sentences used to rhyme! I’d make amazing connections in seconds without thinking.. almost like automatic writing. 

And then there’s the other side effects. Weight gain (I was told it’d not have been an issue if I had more willpower), bad dreams (nightmares every night! I wake up crying in fear!). It is so boring wasting so much time sleeping. I used to have most of every night stretching out in front of me, so much time. So much power, being awake when other people are asleep. Getting about 5 hours of sleep at the moment so nowhere near dangerland. 

My meds don’t really stop me having episodes, either. Feels fairly pointless. Chemists always fucks it up and I have to waste half my life hunting down a basic fucking medication. And there is so much else to do! 

I miss feeling like a god. Sometimes I do feel it still. When I’m outside on a windy day and the wind makes the grass look like the sea. When I climb a mountain. When I sprint down the lane after a 10k run. When I know what someone will say before they say it, when I do well in my Russian practice, when I learn a fascinating new fact of Old English.. sometimes at gigs too. But not as often.

Weird time of year. The days are getting longer again! The wheel is turning!

bipolar,"Hello fellow bipolar spawns.

I’m 20M w Bipolar 2, GAD, ADHD. I take lithium and I have been pretty stable for about a year now since my last manic episode.

So there’s a lot of positive things happening in my life right now

I just finished a whole semester of college for the first time in 2 years which feels amazing. My relationships have been going well and I feel pretty great generally with the holidays coming.

However I have started to notice some pretty major red flags concerning my mood. I have had trouble falling asleep, have been more talkative, more fixated/stimulated about stuff, etc. 

One of the things I did a lot when I was with mania and therefore is a warning sign is that I would change the things around me a lot (the arrangement of my furniture/decorations, the lighting, etc). In the last few days I have being trying to resist the urge to do these kind of things. 

So I’m pretty worried about going back into mania. After my last episode I took it upon myself to learn about this illness and so im pretty informed. Ill definitely be taking my meds religiously as well as and maintining a good sleep hygiene and all the basic stuff.

However I’m wondering if any of you have any experience seeing an episode coming and trying to prevent it.

Well what's terrifying or worrying isn't that, a few weeks ago I started to have a good mood but of the nothing, an immense feeling of love arose in me, it was terrifying, my heart almost burst out because I felt too many things, I began to believe that I had a soulmate with someone, I began to have visions of that person, and I felt like they were watching me through my eyes. , but I really loved her at that moment, I have been delusional before but not something like this, is it normal in cyclothymia to have delusions? This feeling sometimes comes back with the idea that it is watching me, I can't sleep and even though there is evidence that this cannot be possible, I can't stop thinking about it, is it that I have psychotic symptoms again?

bipolar,I used to be very bubbly and nice growing up. I’d always mind my business never get myself into trouble would always do what’s right. I started having a hard time with my emotions in high school and it worked once I was in college and then it got bad after I graduated. I’m currently 22 and was finally diagnosed with bipolar II about 2 months ago. I was prescribed lamotragine to stabilize my mood. I’m not sure if the meds are causing my mood swings but more recently I’ve been really angry and irritated. Earlier today was like the final nail in the coffin. I was going to the mall with my boyfriend so I could get a stuffed animal dolphin that I thought was cute and we were about to park in a spot as we were backing up into it a woman came out of nowhere and  stood in the middle of the spot. I jumped out of the car and asked her to move and she refused cause she wanted her friend to park the car there even tho me and my bf were halfway in the spot. So I asked her again and she started threatening me so I called her an ugly ass bitch and my bf drove off. I just got so angry in that moment that i made him spin around ask I could dump a bunch of leftover rice from Benihana onto the car. This is so unlike me I have never done this in my life and idk why I did it but after all was said and done I had a huge panic attack and it took me 20 minutes to calm down. I tried asking for advice in another subreddit but everyone kept blaming me and telling me I committed a crime. I know it’s not right I just don’t know what got into me in that moment. I just wanna feel ok and happy again this isn’t me. I’m not supposed to be angry and confrontational.

bipolar,"So, for years, like 4 or 5 years straight, I refused medication and drank like the worst alcoholic I’ve ever heard of (literally a handle or more a day). I cycled so rapidly and eventually got into a deep psychotic episode. I’m finally on meds for about two years now and six months sober of everything.

Problem is I destroyed my memory of things I did! But apparently not permanently because things are starting to come back and I’m drowning in the shame and guilt that’s coming up.

I degraded myself so many times. For instance: I did porn for one of those live streaming websites (before OF was a thing) and bragged about it at my high school reunion. Had a threesome with my partner and kept contact with the third even though my partner said I had to stop and if I kept going it would be cheating. I stayed even though they were humiliating me and abusing me and I didnt want it. I signed up on sugar daddy websites and tried to be a sugar baby. That meant so many gross phone calls saying disgusting things and so many times I did this in front of my partner. Humiliated myself and my partner in front of their friends by asking about their sex lives the first time I met them and constantly keeping the conversation about sex. And so much more that keeps flooding into my mind. And I wasn’t even horny during any of it. All I remember is that I wanted attention, something to make me feel better and to know that I was wanted. 

My poor partner was there for me through everything even though I treated them like dirt. They’ve finally snapped and lost their love for me and probably is leaving me. I wish I could’ve taken my meds sooner and gotten sober sooner. I finally tried naltrexone and it’s the only thing keeping me from drinking. It’s like a miracle - I have zero cravings. They went away almost the same day I started that med.

I’m trying to forgive myself or at least be more understanding. I was traumatized with medications being forced into my mouth constantly (stuff I never needed) when I was a kid, so I couldn’t get over that in time before I imploded. I grew up with alcoholics that kept making me drink ever since I was a kid, too. I’m trying to tell myself that of course it’s ok I struggled before I got to this point.

But I can’t!! I can’t stand it!! I’m such a horrible person for what I did to my love, my person, my partner!! The list goes on and on and on and I can’t believe they stayed this long. I don’t blame them for needing to leave me, but I’m absolutely devastated.

I am trying desperately to stop the self-hatred. I needed to vent to people who can understand, hopefully. I’ve been too scared to post here before, but I’m trying now. Please be gentle.

- I was at baseline when she prescribed an antipsychotic to me- I was not depressed or manic at all. It just feels wrong to not start me on a mood stabilizer and straight to the antipsychotic.
- she sorta romanticizes the disorder. For ex: she thinks manic people are geniuses and “the most fun” people. Which idk just makes me feel weird.

Five months ago, i [made this posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/14xw2y9/when_you_are_confronted_with_serious_problems_but/) here in this sub, i'd like to give you an update and i think, Christmas is a very good time to share this.

For those who don't have time to see the link, it was about the problems i faced, my parents were injured in a car crash, my dog was injured, my brother has cancer and i struggled with bipolar.

I'll tell you how it turned out: My parents survived, they still got some problems, but the doc expect a full recovery. They made it, got through with emergency surgery and then the entire process of rehab. It looks better for my brother about cancer, his body responds well to the treatment. There are more, rather small details, like i was able to avoid a relapse with drugs. My dog is also healthy again.

Today, we'll have a christmas dinner together at my family home and no seat will be empty, no one was lost. It was a hard time for all of us. It was at some points critical about life and death.

I'd like to thank the community here in the sub and also i was happy that some of you reached out to me with writing me DM's when i was in that long and dark night. It was the support i needed to keep going on.

Don't lose hope when you get confronted with such serious problems, where you don't know what is coming. Don't give up, even when the odds are stacked against you. In the end, you can still win and live to see better times.

Thanks for your support again, i'm really looking forward to our dinner and that we are all still alive, it's like a happy ending, even when it is just temporary. The good times are where you need to recover and gain new strength, so i will cherish every minute of this. 

P.S.  
They'll never get to read this i guess, but there were good people in the aftermath of the car crash, other cars stopped and civilians gave first aid to my parents, called the emergency services. The firefighters and police did a very good job, same goes for the rescue chopper that airlifted them to the hospital.

bipolar,"’m emotionally and spiritually exhausted. I started the year with high expectations for personal growth and positive changes physically, personally, professionally, &amp; socially. Fast forward to March through May, with da sun and out of hospital once a month. He coded on Easter &amp; was fortunately able to recover without neurological deficits. 

The summer at least for 2 months gave us some respite but first week of August had to send daughter to urgent care for vomiting. Again, fortunately, a one time thing.

Move ahead to October and dad is sick with pneumonia in hospital! That same weekend my mom and I get COVID. After 10 days, I notice my daughter has a lingering cough. Within a month and a half, we are treating once with one antibiotic for 10 days which seems to resolve until she starts coughing again with fevers! Luckily, negative results for all viral tests. But the cough stays and then we get call from her pediatrician and we start on augmentin. Cough is gone!

In the clear? Not yet because once she’s done she develops hives of unknown origin. It doesn’t help that the doctor says it could have been a whole number of things. So now she’s on Benadryl for at most 5 days and see if there’s improvement. 

Plus, we live by a creek that on occasion has reached threatening flood levels. In fact, we are dealing with PTSD from basement flooding 2020 and 2021, the last one life threatening for my husband. His anxiety is so bad when it comes to storms, I feel I absorb it too.

Having written so much, I fear I’m currently in an anxiety induced mania that set me to hospital back in 2021.

It doesn’t help I’m fighting with therapy office about payments that insurance says I didn’t have to pay for PLUS my therapist I’ve had good rapport with is out due to a car accident!

I’m feeling quite overwhelmed that I noticed it is now affecting me at work. I do have people I feel safe with that calm me but it is t always the same people every day.

So, I was already in a bad place and, recently, my mom's be diagnosed with breast cancer and I'm the one who's taking care of everything (going to doctor, dealing with her medical insurance). I've been drowing on a maniac episode since and, because of that, my libido has been so high. However, my bf (M31) hasn't been able to help me with that, so I became needy and more hungry for sex.

We have been together for a long time and I love him a lot, so that's why I've never considered (and ""needed"" having sex with other guys until now. It feels like i'm gonna go crazy if I don't do that now, because life has been drowing me and I just need to release some pressure, but I know this is wrong and that he doesn't deserve that - which is the main reason why I haven't done anything physical. 

I've been trying to control myself, to discover new ways of playing on my on, but it isnt' the same as sex, but i'm feeling so bad about think of doing it with anyone besides my bf. No, i'm not trying to find someone who is gonna say to me that ""cheating is condonable in this situation"", because i'm being strong as fuck to not let my maniac thoughts control my life.

19M 

I'm a transplant recipient and in april 2023 i went into hospital for organ rejection, the treatment for this is multiple steroids at a very very high dose example being 500mg of prednisone, the end result of this and at the time having no medication for bipolar i went into psychosis, i was in hospital from april to i think june or july? i remember none of this and only remember beginning of April and August (a bit of July)

July is when i finally got home from hospital and my Cat died.. so i was dealing with that aswell 


In between this i said some really shit things to my Mom, my little sister, my older brother and my friends.. all of which i don't remember and i only have texts of what i said (i have absolutely no idea of what else beyond this) 

The aftermath of my behavior? well... I'm not allowed to live with my Mom and Little sister, they aren't supporting me in anyway anymore and have told me we can't go back to the way things were because of what i did.. the information i was given of my behavior was this: I'm manipulative, i don't act like family, i guilt trip, i said i don't see my Mom as my mom or friend, i implied my mom doesn't do enough for me, i implied she's not good enough.

What sucks is i do not remember ANYTHING which is scary... i pride myself on being the best person i can be.. i have so much love to give i appreciate everything the people in my life have done for me i try to be understanding and listen to people and i take criticism well.. so it confuses me how i can act so differently and i don't even remember...

since all this happened I've done multiple things to make sure I'm a good person who is still worthy of my mothers love... I've been going to the gym, i stopped drinking completely, I've been going to therapy which is completely draining my wallet without coverage but whatever, I'm working more towards my goals.. I've been controlling myself so much better since being bipolar meds.

because of this i decided to have a conversation with my mother again... it was going well until i completely broke down and started crying and essentially begged for them to take me back... i attempted to explain the psychosis and i expressed how i was scared and the end result of me doing this was her saying i was guilt tripping her... even though to me atleast all i was doing was expressing how I've been feeling.. i didn't blame her for anything i never even brought her into it.. all i did was say the things i was feeling since she said i couldn't live with them anymore it's not like my intention was to manipulate or guilt trip i just needed my mom...

i expressed that i thought if i started improving myself everything would go back to normal and i was told that's not how family works and things will never go back to how they once were...

My living situation atm is a risk to my physical health, I'm likely going to need another transplant in a few years or sooner but i can't get one because i lack support now, I have an older brother but he lives in the states (I'm in Canada) so living with him isn't an option.. i am lost and scared and I'm trying my absolute hardest...

bipolar,"
I put my trust in a select few to help me manage my condition.  A few days ago I was quite happy and anxiety seemed like a distant stranger.  I was putting on a show for my baby girl, singing &amp; dancing in the morning.  Then my husband looked at me strangely.  “Do… do I need to take today off of work?”  I was surprised.  Why would he ask me that?  He pointed out that I was unusually excited, talking fast, etc.  But I was just in a good mood, right? He asked me to check in with my therapist; perhaps he was mistaken.  

Later that day, my therapist confirmed that I was talking faster than usual.  “How’ve you been sleeping?” She asked.  Uh oh..  not very much sleep.  But that’s normal with a baby, right?  Except baby had been sleeping through the night &amp; I… had not.  

So I agreed to take the steps to address the hypo-mania.  I took my emergency, fast-acting anti-psychotic; cancelled a play date I had planned &amp; went to bed early that night.   I got 12 hrs of sleep.  Groggy, I emerged the next day after a hard reset.  Sure I don’t feel quite as sing-songy or ready to run a marathon.  But I feel good.  I listened to the people I trust and I took care of myself.  

 Even if the highs feel really good.  Even if they don’t exactly feel like highs, I know where they can lead.  I have responsibilities, a child to care for.  I’m thankful for my husband &amp; my therapist.  And I’m proud of myself. 

TL/ DR: I trusted my husband &amp; therapist when they identified I might be hypomanic &amp; took corrective action to manage my Bipolar.

I have been out of the news cycle for about a week now. I can't take it. There's almost always bad news.

So now I'm medicated and hoping it all works out, but it's really hard explaining it to people. Mostly because people are always like , ""You need to do this or that"" and it's like, ""It doesn't work that way"". For me it feels empty and hopeless. It's not just bipolar (type 2) that I deal with. I also have bad OC and ADHD. Just typing this out is hard because like ""Doug"", ""squirrel!""

Someone asked the question, “Would you date a bipolar person?”

The answers were overwhelmingly no. That it’s not worth the trouble. That they are hard to live with. That they will blame you and resist medication. That they will make your life hell.
Some people commented positive comments. Still, it made me cry.

I just feel like no one would ever want to be with me if they knew. I began to think that I didn’t want to date at all and I’d rather be alone, than be vulnerable with someone. Being with this guy has made me think he’s worth the risk. 

We actually started dating last year but I was severely unstable and using him to distract myself from my reality. I got bored and faded away, telling him I’m not interested in dating anyone. He was understanding and kind about it. 
Long story short, I am back in town and he started following me all of a sudden on Instagram again. I reached out. Now that I am stable , I am emotionally available . I can’t believe I let him go in the first place. When we met up and were having an intimate moment, he told me multiple times that he had missed me.

I am mentally ill. I’ve been mentally ill probably since the age of 11. I’m newly diagnosed bipolar 2(unmedicated) . 
I wanted to know if there really were other people who went through this- I have been chronically depressed for 20 days straight. No one else in my personal life can relate to this level of depression. The lack of motivation, sleepiness, and sadness are really killing my vibe. It’s been a struggle to do basic tasks like, clean, bathe, cook and eat. I feel so guilty because my partner has been picking up the slack.

bipolar,"Hello! 

I am writing this because I need some perspective, insights and experiences. 

  
I have been diagnosed for roughly a year, but I have had this disorder for about 2.5-3 years. During this time I have never told my family, they know nothing about my well-being and I have liked to keep it separate. I live in another city and only see them once or twice a month. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the issue is that my conversation therapist has been pushing me lately to tell them. He believes that this would drop a stone off my shoulders. While he is likely correct, I can only see bad things coming out of this. My family very rarely talk about our issues and pains. Cronical illnesses are mentioned in passing by and serious pain is kept under the rug. This isn't healthy or good but it is how we do things. However, I also know that by telling my mother, the rest of my family and relatives would know within a week. I wouldn't want this. I also know that I would never get a moment of peace after telling her, everything would become about my well-being and she would never see me anymore only the disorder. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, the real question is:

Is there anyone like me who didn't want to tell anyone but eventually did? What were the outcomes, do you regret it, etc. etc. 

I would appreciate all answers and experiences that might help me make a decision.

bipolar,"hey everyone this is my second ever reddit post so bear with me please. 

21F, i was diagnosed around 1.5/2 years ago after i had my first manic episode. i have also been diagnosed with GAD, a dissociative disorder, and PTSD. i am unmedicated for all of these willingly as i was on abilify, but could not take it consistently and my parents worried about the physical effects of going off and on meds (family history of blood clots, stroke, etc.). i started using daylio to track my moods and have worked on a lot of grounding/coping mechanisms to somewhat alleviate my various symptoms.

i’ve been staying with my family who i haven’t seen in a few years (i grew up with them but moved across the US when i was 15) and while it has been lovely, they are in poor health. my time here has been very sweet and i’ve been feeling good, but i can tell when i leave in a few days i’m probably going to have a depressive episode. 

i’ve dealt with my depression fairly well through my life, and i can identify it easily before i’m truly in the throes of it. the last true depressive episode i had was entirely different because i had what i can only describe as symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, ideation, paranoia). does anyone have any tips on how to manage those symptoms if they come up? last time this happened i was on “watch” for two weeks and couldn’t work, which i can’t do this time due to my financial situation. 

i am also wondering if anyone has any tricks to identifying manic episodes. i’ve had a few but until i was diagnosed after my first, i hadn’t experienced that before. i tend to not understand my mania until i’m at the tail end of an episode, usually after i’ve done something reckless/“bad” (spending money, getting new jobs, driving for extreme amounts of time/traveling, etc.) i’m worried this time because if i am about to have a depressive episode, my family has expressed to me that i could move with them back to my home town. im worried that i will take them up on this offer and not completely think it through (leaving my current primary support system for a cross country move) 

i think the fact that im thinking about this now is a good sign, but i tend to dissociate during my manic episodes so im not sure if ill even remember the pros and cons of moving back to be with my family. 

any tips are appreciated, sorry for word vomiting &lt;3",Struggling identifying episodes/ managing functioning,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.27735798211020646,-0.27735798211020646,0,1,0,1,0,No_Scallion238,-0.4203452324678521,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,1

bipolar,"First off, i wanna start by saying that this is pretty long.
If you don’t give a shit i completely understand, have a peaceful day. 

So, i’ve always fought to get a diagnosis because i thought that it would validate my experience and people would finally stop treating me like i’m exaggerating. Ive been to the psych clinic 2 times this year and i’ve been on meds and all that. But i hadn’t seen it on paper you know. And recently i finally did. Turns out i was diagnosed with bipolar? They just didn’t tell me. And now i feel empty and sad. I don’t want that diagnosis anymore because i feel like i can’t go back you know? It would be for life if i wasn’t diagnosed too but this feels more official. Everytime i see something about bipolar being for life, tears well in my eyes. Like yea congrats you’re stuck with this because we said so, the only thing you can do about it is take those meds that you hate and pay for expensive therapy sessions. 

I feel like an ingrate. I wanted someone to tell me that i wasn’t delusional but now that it has happened, i want the opposite. Please go back on your words and tell me it was just a phase and i won’t have to seriously consider ending it all anymore. I think i was in deep denial, in more than one way. I wanted to reassure myself that i wasn’t « worthless to society » and just a product of my trauma. But thinking about it now, i don’t actually give a shit about pleasing anyone in this depressing world. Am i fraud?
I’m conflicted because on one hand i don’t wanna be a burden to the people i genuinely care about, but on the other hand i don’t wanna be a « useful member of society » because i despise this disgusting society i live in. Besides the people i love i can’t think of a single reason i would want to hang on. I find fault in everything. I’m cynical and negative (i’m probably only saying this bc i’m depressed rn but whatever). I just can’t help myself, i don’t wanna keep the peace and no matter how hard i try to convince myself otherwise, i almost never want to put in effort. 
I know i’m not a terrible person, i have values, i try to help people as best as i can and i would never hurt anyone intentionally. So why do i feel so stupid and mean and unreasonable ??? :(

bipolar,"I have Type 2 BP, ever since I moved into my boyfriend's family's home my depressive lows have been increasing and I've been sleeping for days and can't find a way out of it easily. There are a few days I manage to live out a whole day normally.

I was diagnosed professionally when I was a child at 7 and had therapy until I was 16.
I'm 25 now and since 17, I never medicate for it anymore and I take daily vitamins and have a focused diet to keep me more stable. 

My boyfriend's family is very laid back and understanding so there is no issue at all with them which I am thankful for. 

My boyfriend and I spend every second together and he seems to never handle my bipolar lows well at all. I'm very calm during my low episodes, just extremely fatigue, overwhelmingly sad, and distant. When I sleep for long hours, my boyfriend takes it personally and feels very victimized. He tends to ask questions almost everyday now. He asks ""Do you love me?"" ""Are you happy with me?"" ""You don't want to do anything with me?""
This is almost heartbreaking and I've repeatedly told him that I'm having episodes and I do my best to ground myself daily but they are very prevalent having bipolar. It feels like there's a part of his brain that will never comprehend the struggle of bipolar being entirely internal and has nothing to do with him. I do believe it is making my episodes worse now that his victimized outbreaks are a daily reaction. He thinks I'm angry at him all the time or ignoring him on purpose or I don't want anything to do with him. I never argue, I just shut down emotionally and get paralyzed to function to talk or even look in the eyes, giving a distant atmosphere often. It turns into me having to comfort him in the amidst of melancholy daily and this energy having to remind him constantly that I love him and it has nothing to do with him is exhausting. 

I have a great relationship with him and we are very caring to each other, but these episodes are affecting him a lot and making me worse with his reaction. 

I really don't know how to explain this to him, I've talked about it endlessly in detail of the reality of BP. I never sent articles or informational sites to him.

bipolar,"Hello, i hope everything and y’all are okay 🍀
I (26) diagnosed 2 years ago and i have met my exboyfriend (23) in this July while I have been stable for 2 months after a major depression. He was a traveler and my city was his last station. We bounded so fast, had great times together but we were hyping each other. I still don’t know if i have had a slight hypo mania or i was falling in love… Also we both couldn’t understand if it’s love or strong impression. By the time he visited me again, it didn’t go well this time. We had such intense conversations and pointless fights. The last day we decided to save the relationship and he went. We couldn’t make it, wished the best for each other and cut the painter.
After a little while he texted me some very awkward messages and asked to call. In this calling I could sense something was wrong about his mindset, he was talking about creating a new language and that kind of big things. Since we have a long distance I couldn’t do anything but worry. I felt like I was affecting his mind and I felt guilty. We ended talking 2,5 months ago till last Friday, he send my favorite perfume that he ordered while we were talking. I couldn’t take the shipping bcs of the customs. I texted to report what happened before he recoup and say thank you&amp;take care. He didn’t answer three days. I texted again taht “Can you please just send a sign that I can understand if you and we are okay? It beats me and i think we don’t deserve this. Any sign that i can make sense the situation is fair enough”. He said “Hey. We are completly ok. I had a psychosis two months ago. And now I’m trying to get better. It’s a shame that the parfume cannot arrive. I knew it would be a problem but I tried with the lying method.  Didnt work 🤷‍♂️. I hope you’re  doing ok as well. 
Take care” I felt devastated and i still do. I partly blame myself for his psychosis… It was his first serious relationship and came too much for him. Our lives were so different and the affection was unbalanced, he was the one got affected mostly.
I am saying partly because he was using mari since he was 17. Even though I know this is the main and rational reason for psychosis, I also know deeply that I triggered and contributed. when I saw his message I couldn’t stay rational and said “I can’t describe how much i am sorry Josh… I feel terrible about my unintentional contribution for this. At our last call I could sense something but I couldn’t do anything, I’ve felt like whatever I do would be another harm for you. I won’t hurt you again ever, I hope nothing can hurt your beautiful heart. I hope you get better and, the best 🤍” He didn’t respond.
I really feel so bad and I regret what I wrote. I don’t know if he didn’t respond because he blames me, too or we already said goodbye for the last time… I feel like shit.

bipolar,"I (27F w/ BP) was watching a Ted talk about understanding bipolar disorder where the speaker claimed that bipolar cannot be cured. In the comment section there were a few people claiming that they’ve seen it cured through first or second hand experiences.

from what I understand there is research that supports the the idea that bipolar might not be curable. I personally don’t believe it can be cured but it can definitely be treated to mitigate the problems it causes which leads to a functioning human being and that’s more than enough.. but is it? Is there a different way for this story to end?

 I’ve been struggling with it since I was a preteen and I’ve gotten to the point where instead of looking for light at the end of the tunnel, I am comforted and at home in its darkness. Is that a bad way to view my condition? Is it negative or realistic?

How did they cure themselves? Can it really be done?

bipolar,"I’m writing this post as if to myself, but I figured it would be helpful (mainly for myself tbh) to share it with you folks.

I received my diagnosis a few months ago during the summer, and though my psychiatrist used a lot of words to describe me, the gist of it was that I have Bipolar I Disorder. His actual diagnostic impression was much more nuanced, but it all pointed to the same thing:

There’s something wrong with me; I’m unstable in the most explicit sense of the word.

That’s what it all pointed to, but I’ve come to learn I’m much more than bipolar. I had my first true mania a year ago, and it got so bad (I became psychotic) that I had to withdraw from school and take a semester off.

I came back and I had to withdraw again, this time because I was too depressed. I was in the throes of a cannabis addiction, and things weren’t looking good.

I feel like myself again, though, and I’ve finally got it. I can’t tell you the moment I felt it, but at some point the broken pieces of my life came together like a puzzle. Like kintsugi. I can feel things start to turn around for me, even if I don’t always know with certainty.

Ever since I ‘misplaced my mind’ last year, people look at me differently, and never in my life have I been so solitary. I’ve decided, then, that I need to learn to keep myself company. And I have. My diagnosis is very isolating, but I’ve finally made some peace with it. Mental illness or no, it’s me all the way down, and the people who I care about won’t judge me.

bipolar,"Had a terrible manic episode in early November which finally got me diagnosed. Started on new meds (previously I was only medicated for depression and the high dose of antidepressants only made my mania worse) Lamictal and Zyprexa along with a lower dose of antidepressant.

Well, now the mania is over and I feel worse. So much worse. For the last week or so, I've been feeling inadequate, like I haven't achieved anything in life and will never do so. I'm feeling mildy suicidal as well.

I have a holiday arranged that I'm going by myself that I have been looking forward to for months. My psychiatrist suggested that I cancel the trip and even that I should be admitted to the hospital because of my suicidal thoughts.

Now I'm terrified. What if I do the unthinkable when I'm there all by myself? I don't think I will do anything. Even though I was suicidal for years I've never actually attemped it (though there was one time where I came very close which ended up with me being voluntarily admitted to the hospital). I feel like I deserve this holiday though. I haven't treated myself to anything in years and I genuinely feel like I've deserved this holiday but I'm so conflicted right now.

My doctor now prescribed me some Xanax to decrease the symptoms along with the meds I've also mentioned. It did decrease the anxiety for the last 3 days but I am worried that I'm gonna do something stupid there when I'm by myself.

After I had multiple alcohol indused amnesia and came down from my episode i admitted myself to the psychward in my country (after multiple attempts from my doctor and my mom but I gaslighted and manipulated them into thinking I'm fine.)

After I was admitted I asked my mom to text my brother who was were close to me during my childhood (not so much now) bc I needed his support and I wanted to apologize for all the things I did during my mania.

He never reached out, asked me how i was, and he even promised my mom to text me (which he never did).

Fast forward to today bc xmas was actually quite fun with my mom and I genuenly enjoyed being with her after every shit that happened this year.

We went to my brothers house and he SAUD NOTHING.
I said there without a word smiling at his kid getting a present and I bursted out crying.
It was so uncomfortable being there knowing they dont like me for what happened.
I stood up, put my shoes on and he came after me saying ""What the fuck is wrong?""
I explained in a few words how it hurt that he never once reached out to me during all of this and he said ""Well noone told me who brought you in to the hospital? And if it was even the psych ward, how else would i know if it was a surgery or smth else?""

bipolar,"Background story

&amp;#x200B;

I had depression since I was 13 years old. Nevertheless, I studied hard to go to a good college. When I entered my college, the department office tried to open an interview with a decent TV channel. (At least to my professors, I was an exceptionally good case.) I showed the symptoms of depression, but I was unmedicated because I did not know anything about mental health issues. I just thought ""it is what it is"" and bottled up my issues. It was only third year of college that I went to doc. (this was 2017)

&amp;#x200B;

Ever since 2017, I started taking depression meds. Of course, they did not work out. Back then, I did not know I was bipolar. So I worked my ass off WITHOUT the help of mood stabilizers and what not.  Still, (thanks to caffeine and nicotine) I graduated college with a good GPA.

Everything seemed perfect. I started my MA degree at the fall of 2021. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now

However, things got fucked up. In 2021 winter, My first hypomanic episode occurred. I was not hospitalized, but I went to several hospitals to change meds. 

Ever since 2022, I feel like a different person. I think my function is deteriorating. I became lazy and depressed. I could not meet deadlines. I almost failed all classes. It kinda affected my concentration and attention. Very recently I have a hard time reading novels. (I am literature major and I used to read and write a lot)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So, all these things being said, do you think I should my career?

I have always considered doing GRE or LSAT to fulfill my life goals. But unfortunately things got fucked up.

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think I have to give up and change career? lmao

These lights mostly shine through the windows that don't have any bars for curtains/blinds or anything, so I'm screwed until these neighbors take their Xmas lights down for the year.

My friends were making jokes about my sexuality (I’m bisexual) and saying I would suck dicks for money if I was traveling and needed money. One of them said I’d make an igloo out of cum and live in it. I got really upset, sent back very personally attacking messages saying the worst, friendship ending, things I could. The next level to this is that I was now in a terrible mood and on the verge of tears. I had to leave the dinner early because I was so upset and didn’t want my mood to ruin everyone else’s night.

Since then, I have been cycling through grandiosity/artistic expression and handing out thousands of spiritual gifts.  I’ve experienced life on a totally different plane.

bipolar,"Hi, I’m new to this Reddit and I would love to just hear some thoughts and advice is greatly appreciated. 

I’m 31, F and has been going through life with a major depression diagnosis from age 15. 

This last year I was in the process of being possibly diagnosed with adhd, which branched out to possibly be cptsd. It’s been a long year of self discovery to say the least. 

But then I had an episode, which seems to most likely be hypomania, as I suddenly felt happy and not needing to sleep. I didn’t do anything drastic, I just felt happy which was new to me. I could go be with friends and people without being tired for days after, I liked myself, I didn’t ruminate or have my usual panic attacks. I didn’t hate myself, and I suddenly felt my libido coming back. 

When I couldn’t sleep and I was disassociating I understood something was wrong, and I’m in contact with my doctors and family and they suspect bipolar 2. 

Now that I’m no longer in hypomanic state, I’m very confused as life doesn’t feel the same anymore. I’ve gotten the taste of what happiness should feel like, so now I’ve stopped to force myself to do things to seem happy. But this makes me not able to function as an adult. I’ve lost my job (which weren’t a good match for me anyway, it was a bad environment for people with mental health struggles), and I should feel like a failure. But I don’t, I feel content with just existing. And this scares me. My whole life has changed after this experience, and now I feel like there’s a current of emotions and triggers flowing through me, but as long as I just try to stay calm and don’t push myself, it doesn’t affect me as much anymore. 

Is this normal? To go from being severely depressed (with ocd, social anxiety, panic attacks, ed, body dysmorphia and more) to suddenly just feeling content and suddenly confident and loving myself? I’ve done things I’ve been to scared to do my whole life (be open about myself, trust my friends, set boundaries, taken care of myself by speaking up, be confident in my body (I managed to reach the top while rock climbing for the first time in my life, I’ve been climbing for over a year)).

My friends and family tells me they don’t see me do anything that warrants me being hypomanic right now, and I don’t feel like I am right now. But I still have remnants of happiness and confidence, and it’s confusing. 

I’m very grateful for input and knowledge, as I’ve tried to read up on bipolar, but since I’m not a very straight forward case it seems, I’m a little lost.",Possible bipolar 2,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,Small-Blueberry-4125,-0.48776958685523125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,22,2
bipolar,"It wasn’t anything crazy, he’s known for a while that I want to get married but he just hasn’t been ready for any talks about it which I completely understand. He’s still finishing his degree and has to get a stable full time job once he graduates before we can even have a serious discussion anyway. While I feel like I’m ready I don’t want to rush him, we’re still a few years from 30 and I don’t want him to make any decision because he feels like he has a deadline.

He knows that I want to get married and it’s never bothered him. He knows I have a Pinterest board full of engagement rings and wedding stuff that I go on regularly. 

Today I was joking with him about how my coworker asked me why he hasn’t proposed yet (we’ve been together about 4 years) , and he actually started talking about it? He was saying he wants to make sure he gets a god job so he can save up for a ring, was asking me what types of rings I like, and even asked if I wanted a diamond or some other type of stone. 

I know it’s not a real marriage talk, but he has never gotten into it like that before. He told me that while he needs to get a good job before he can propose he doesn’t plan on making me wait forever. Up until this point he just kind of smiled at and indulged me while I mention cute places to propose or a wedding dress I like, but this time he actually started getting involved.

I’m not expecting to see him on one knee any time soon, but knowing that he does have some type of plan or is at least thinking about it makes me unbelievably happy. I’m so in love with this man and all I want is for us to live a happy life together.

A few days ago, I had a traumatic(?) experience. Since then, I have been feeling depressed. Last night when sitting outside with my partner, I became mute.

I felt affectively neutral during this. I have been feeling ‘off’ since the event, and have felt a lot angrier.

bipolar,"I got my currently job on September of this year after a clusterfuck hiatus down spiral bullshit that happened during my last job where I end up hospitalized and unemployed for over 3 months.

I’m a registered nurse. This would be my first job acting as such. Before I had worked on other clinical settings but as a student or an assistant nurse. I was glad of having the opportunity more so because the initial gig was too good to be true. Then I got kicked out of my first role and forced to do something I didn’t want to and hate.

Three months in and I always try not to dwell on it. Try to change mi mindset every day to the fact that I’m learning a bunch of different things that otherwise I wouldn’t, that I live 15 mins from work and that I don’t expect to be there more than a year or two.

It is hard, very hard. So hard that there’s been days where I had to call in because I was in crisis. It has been hell for me to comply with my meds regime because of the crazy hours and too much to do to even stop for taking them plus they were making me have tremors and I hated it because patients would get scare and think that I was being nervous.


Calling in just got me into trouble now with Human Resources being concern of my repetitive absences. I tried to explain it to my supervisor and let them know that I can’t always provide evidence since my issue is a mental health condition and my doctors won’t be available to me unless I have an appointment which has been a pain in the ass to get one lately because I assume they are on vacation.

I haven’t been able to enjoy the holidays. Didn’t decorate or celebrated shit because I’ve been having rough days lately. I was only looking forward to New Year’s Eve because I was going to be off the next day and that’s gone as well. I just woke up with a message from my supervisor telling that he had to change my shift to a night one because people already called in sick for New Year’s. I was furious because I find it unfair for many reasons including him allowing it from so early and because I had already shared my mental health issues with him and instead of picking someone else he chose me.

bipolar,"I've been in therapy since 2021, and now (past few months) only my meds, that i take religiously since i was diagnosed about 7 months ago.

I live with my partner, and before my meds we used to have huge discussions that lasted days, he'd trigger me and say nasty things and I'd do the same until the point of exhaustion, miscommunication being always the key. In the past months i noticed that these discussions decreased in frequency and duration, after a lot of efforts to hold back on my part, plus the meds are working i guess. 

Some things trigger me into berserk mode and I'm aware, i try to not blame it on him and always apologize, but I have a strong feeling he does not do the same. And when he gets irrational and starts a huge fight, he blames me for how things turned out, has a hard time apologizing or acknowledging my feelings or how much harder it is for me to hold back. He often accuses me of repeatdly gaslighting him, which is not my intention (doesn't mean i don't do it) most times. I'm seeing this situation and now I can't think about it without feeling anguished, this whole thing is making me feel sick.

So... Idk what to think. So many ppl here claim they don't recognize themselves or their actions sometimes, me included, and I'm certainly to blame for a lot of things in my personal relationships. Maybe I'm being too much and don't realize it because it's someone close to me. I'm asking this here because maybe someone can relate.

Add oil to a fire

If I light up perhaps they won’t leave me

Harm of flopping like a fish in dry air

All I need is a snare to mistake for support 

Meet and dissolve with a ghost

Get worked up when I lie to myself

Never ill—just tore a gill and I can’t get up the fall

Won’t you peck at me?

Claw me like a monster

Call it help

Netted in a cow catcher

Frantic to have gills wet

When no support around

So bloated

You a tick to me

I feel like disease 

People don’t want my name

Just something to bleed

Unfair deal

Why must I be the one situated in need?

Only got heard when I folded like a chair

Polished knees

Branches with leaves are heading to dead and don’t bend but break

Better if stranded that tethered to another’s totem

Sometimes feel accepted when I’m treated as a bulletin board

Lonely on a steppe with no clan to claim

Get cornered when vulnerable

Polished as a floor

Sediments falling as confetti

Meshed to it 

Like combines over me to be taken off

Tear like cloth

Wrapped on branches as a charm

To cook and rattle as a snake 

Cannibalizing

Eaten

They instead told me that I have bipolar disorder due to some of my family’s history and my sexual history (I explained that id go through random periods where I’d do things without thinking of consequences until much later). This diagnosis took maybe 5-10 minutes max and I was prescribed meds and sent on my way.

This kind of makes sense, because I’ve been taking lamotrigine for 3 years now and have tried multiple different meds for mania and nothing seems to help at all. I still have mood swings, but I’m not sure that I’ve ever consistently had a manic or depressive episode. It’s really just extreme mood swings.

I stopped getting my period around the time I had spinal surgery July 2022. I was very worried and went to my obgyn. They did a blood test and saw that my prolactin levels were off the charts. They recommended an MRI, but because I was on disability with no insurance yet, I couldn't get it done and I was discharged from the practice.

Lately I have been doing some research and found that Risperidone could cause lack of period. I stopped it cold turkey (I know) because I was scared, and when we retested my blood, prolactin was at a much safer range even though it was still very high.

bipolar,"Me (32F) and my bf (31M) have been together for 3 years, living together for 6 months, and this summer we decided to get married. Our wedding is scheduled for April next year.

I was diagnosed bipolar when I was 16, and I have been suicidal for the last 7 years or so. When I was 16, I started a 7 year on and off relationship with someone who lied a lot and tried to manipulate me, and that relationship really changed me in a very negative way and affected my relationships ever since.

I agreed to marry my bf because I was absolutely sure that I would kill myself one day, and I wanted my bf to inherit my house. This has to do with the laws in our country but your partner is not your heir unless you are legally married and you cannot freely dispose of everything you own in a will. The house we live is mine (I have a mortgage, but I paid the down payment all alone), and I'm doing well financially but he is not.

I was never in love with my boyfriend, but I do love him; I started a relationship with him because I was lonely and I think he was lonely too. He is a kind hearted, supportive person. We have the same sense of humor and we share one specific interest, but that's it. I'm a bit of brainy person and I can't have any deep conversation with him because he sees the world in black and white terms and he doesn't read or try to learn. He's in a low paid job and believes he'll only advance in life if he wins the lottery. He lived with his parents until he was 31 and he never did any chores. He's still a bit hopeless around the house. He has his chores that he does half-assed so momma (me) doesn't scold him. He can't do a load of laundry or fix a lightbulb or use the stove. Our sex life is meh. I believe sexual compatibility can be worked on, but ours has only improved slightly, he's a bit clumsy and slow to take feedback and he once did something I don't like and wouldn't stop even when I told him. We're not even doing anything for our wedding because he can't afford it, we're only getting married at the registry. I wanted an elopement but he can't afford it. But he can afford spending thousands of $ on legos.

I think our relationship has nothing wrong, but nothing too good about it either. We're probably more friends than lovers and I think that is something awesome to have in old age, but I'm only 32.

About 2 months ago my meds changed, I'm now on lamotrigine 200mg + quetiapine 200mg. And for the first time in 7 yrs I am not suicidal. And I'm reconsidering if I want to get married or not.

I'm really not sure what I think. I'm sure I'm not in love with him but I do love him for who he is. I think maybe I can live without sex. 

I always get a bit depressed during Christmas time, and that may be clouding my judgement. I have a track record of jumping into relationships impulsively because I feel lonely, and I imagine people instead of taking them for who they are. But for the first time in my life I feel like I want to be alone. But I'm afraid I may get lonely again down the road. And my bf does keep me company, and except for not being very helpful around the house he's generally fun to live with.

I've been feeling lethargic, which is normal for me during this time of the year. However the meds are great because it's the first time in years that I feel sad but don't think about killing myself.

I'm sure that if I break up with my bf, he'll move back in with his family since he doesn't make enough money to support himself. His parents were dying to get him out of the house and he doesn't even have a bedroom in their home any longer. It really saddens me to think that he will be lonely and sad and living back home with his parents. I think he has potential but he's not advancing in life because he has a victim mentality and can't think critically about himself.

bipolar,"So i guess i just want to hear some thoughts about this. im debating whether I should tell my psychiatrist a couple of instances I thought I was manic, or should I just ignore it. Im not sure if its a manic episode or not but maybe u guys can help? 

So there was a week last month that I got addicted to watching volleyball games. I watched even the oldest videos on the internet and sleep late every night due to this. It eventually lead to doing stretching and vball warm ups in the morning and I feel energized even with a few hours of sleep. The following days I went to the mall to buy rubber shoes for volleyball and a ball even with a tight budget. May partner stopped me with buying the ball but I definitely got the expensive shoes. That time I was thinking of quitting on all my passion and start a new career in volleyball and dreamt that maybe one day Ill make it to the Philippine Volleyball League. 

Now I realize how delusional I am that time and I feel embarrassed with myself. Is this something I should tell my psychiatrist? Or should I just ignore it?

There was also another time that I attended the eras tour film and I was singing and dancing to music so much during the film, and bought lots of merchandise under a tight budget and suddenly thought of doing it as a buy and sell business. The next day I almost died of committing suicide. Almost all the merch I bought is still with me unsold.

bipolar,"
Just wanted to jot down my own thoughts, feel free to share your own journey. 

During the summer I had a mental breakdown (this is what my therapist called it) which led to me taking a decent attempt at my life. 

What followed was months of depression and a whole lot of suicidal ideation. I honestly didn't think I would get out of that hole/couldn't see a way out of it.

Very slowly, with therapy sessions every week, I'm at the stage today where I can breathe without feeling suffocated. I've gone from a very high safety risk to a very low risk with little to no suicidal ideation. 

I never thought I would get to the stage of looking forward to what the future brings. (No job, on disability, with half a degree) but I no longer care about all of that stuff. It took me 27 years to finally start caring about my own self. 

Anyway, thank you to this sub, it's been a great help to me during times of need and you guys are a lovely bunch.",Slowly getting better,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Just Sharing'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.18353567663091794,-0.18353567663091794,0,1,0,1,0,Fair_Double_1628,-0.38663305527416253,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,16,2

bipolar,"Regardless of how well I'm doing, regardless of how successful I am in managing life, projects and people.... I will take the first chance to dissociate. By dissociate, I mean getting holed up at home and simply shutting off reality - not checking my phone, emails, not answering anything - and sleeping excessively or just devoting my waking hours to learning more about some of my obsessions, daydreaming or binge-watching shows. Anyway, it's always an activity that's not integral to my life in any way. I stop reading, learning, communicating, working, writing... and just exist on another level, untouchable, unfocused, unbothered by Life. I live for that feeling of being disconnected. It's my ultimate fantasy and greatest reward.

Yeah, that's how it feels... as if though I have succeeded at hiding from space and time, and god-awful messaging apps.

Actually, even on a good day (being productive, active, etc), in the evening I must have an hour or two of total dissociation, just existing in a fantasy world, before going to bed. It's like I need to wash off reality from me.

This is causing shitstorms in my life... I forget to reply something important to someone, I tend to forget or cancel my client appointments, I might overlook a super crucial email... it makes me look flaky, uninterested, irresponsible.... and I hate that, especially now as I'm doing all I can to rebuild a worthy life for myself.... but it happens all the time... it's like a super strong need within me, it's like I can't live without taking pauses from this world. It scares me. And it makes me really sad.

Does anyone have any similar experiences? How do you overcome this?

bipolar,"Hi everyone 
I’m 19 years old and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder earlier this year. I’ve noticed when I go into episodes I leave…like physically run away and it scares the shit out of my family and sometimes even myself, when it happens it’s like I am a different person and can’t control myself. My family will frantically be calling and texting me but I just won’t answer them and make them think something awful happened to me. My most recent and most dangerous one happened tonight. I walked probably about 30 minutes in pitch black darkness on a busy highway from my grandparents house to my house: everyone was frantically calling me but I ignored everything. It all happened over a fight I had with my mother and sister. I’ve also had a pretty rough few days.
Does anyone else do this? I’m worried that one day I do something like this and get myself in a legit dangerous situation. I scared my mother so much she won’t speak to me.

I recently came out of a manic episode that lasted about a month or a bit longer from September to October. Since then I’ve been dealing with large amounts of irritability; arguably before the episode as well I think. I don’t believe I payed good enough attention to this until after the episode. The anger I felt during the episode was… aggressive. I had to create a safety plan because I wanted to hurt someone and was soooo mad at my therapist- who I literally love😔. I made such horrible decisions during my episode that don’t fit me at all. I’ve been feeling the effects of that recently with the mental analysis eating me up.

I cannot shake the anger though. I stare at people when upset because I can’t calm down. If I can’t speak I still try to convey a sense of control. I want to squeeze glass cups in my hand when I think of things that anger me (I typically analyze things that have happened when eating bc I don’t eat with electronics around, and we only have glass cups). I get annoyed too easily.

I hate it. Everything annoys me. I hate it so much and I’m hoping someone can offer some insight on how to handle bipolar anger.

I'm also sorry if this post comes out weird formatting-wise, I am not super familiar with Reddit. Final apology, I did not find any duplicates of these questions but I apologize if I maybe just missed them.

I have two real questions about my depressive episodes.

My first, is there a difference between a depressive episode and just experiencing sad things in life?I have been really depressed for a while. It's been about the same amount of time as previous depressive episodes except where those didn't have a reason, I believe this one has come as a direct result of a problem I've been dealing with with a really close friend.

I know that not every time I get sad is a depressive episode. And I know that people without bipolar disorder get sad. But is being depressed and miserable for weeks because of a problem that's been persisting for weeks a depressive episode? Or am I just sad? Does that make sense?

And second is about insomnia. In this depression I've been dealing with for the last couple months, I haven't been sleeping much at all. The most I've slept on any given night is just under four hours and even that was kind of a miracle.

I'm not doing anything stimulating, all devices are powered off and put away, I just stare at the ceiling for hours. Sometimes thinking, sometimes not thinking at all. I am constantly exhausted but no matter how tired I am, I cannot sleep even a little bit.

I have tried melatonin, magnesium, and every other thing I could find on the internet, but nothing's helped. And I can't do prescription sleep medication because I have a history of abusing them.

So my question is is this normal? Is there anything I can do? Or do I just kind of have to ride it out? I'm sure everyone is different, but I would love to know how anyone facing something similar has helped.",A Couple Questions About Bipolar II,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.26395479561316526,-0.26395479561316526,0,1,0,0,0,sorrygottagonow,-0.4203452324678521,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,7,2

bipolar,"I feel like I've just been slapped in the face by a depression ghost. Like it just snuck up behind me, knocked the wind out of my lungs and sucked every atom of goodness from my body in literal seconds.

For context, I was diagnosed bipolar three years ago and have managed it successfully with meds. I can work late, stress moderately, enjoy the occassional drink, and even pull off the odd all-nighter, all without any serious shift in mood. 

But after spending most of today with friends and family, laughing over a few beers, I got home, walked into my bedroom and just felt the life drain out of me.

I very nearly forgot what this kind of depression felt like.
It's this thick cloud of darkness that swallows you up. 
An unbearable weight of despair, from which only thoughts of worthlessness and paranoia can grow. 
A sadness so deep, without reason or explanation, that it ignites fear - fear that it cannot be justified or controlled.
Fear that no one will understand, or would want to understand. 
Fear that I am alone. 
I look in the mirror and wonder why I even exist. Everything around me is grey and lifeless and I feel useless and pathetic. I start to believe that my life contributes nothing to this world and that my existence is a bane to all those around me.

Its been a while since I last felt this way and I have no idea what triggered this episode.. But previous experience has taught me a few coping techniques:

- Sleep is usually always the best remedy. 
- As painful as it feels now, its usually less so by tomorrow. 
- And an early dose of (prescribed) quetiapine can bring sleep on much, much quicker. 
- If the above doesn't work then I know to call my psychiatrist for help. 
Knowing all of this is usually the reassurance I need to get me through the day.


I actually came here to remind myself that depression is a familiar burden shared by many in this sub. I remember that I am not alone, and that in itself is a relief. 
I also wanted to document this experience for myself, as a kind of reassuring memo for future episodes. But now that it's written, I've decided to post it instead. And maybe..hopefully.. my shared experience might ease the burden of another bipolar soul in need.

And now off I go to heed my own advice and have a good long sleep. Here's hoping tomorrow is a better day :)",When the depression hits hard..

bipolar,"The last few days have been Christmas celebrations for me and it me realize that I really don't like my family. My parents are divorced (and my dad's absent) so for the first time in the years since covid I really saw my dad around Christmas time. My stepmom invited me to her family’s Christmas celebration and I thought it would be fun so I went. I talked to people and most importantly I talked to my stepbrother—who I haven't really talked to in years—about my bipolar. He was so nice and understanding but not in a fake way, he was just honest. The rest of her family was also so nice and just spoke to me like I was a part of their family. And they spoke to each other nicely as well, and not in a fake nice way just nice. And when they poked fun at each other it just felt like jokes. It was nice.

Then I went to my real mom’s family’s Christmas. It was horrible. Half the people didn't get anyone anything and everyone was kinda just mean like they always are. Some things specifically were said that made me feel shitty—like literally about me—and it kinda ruined my mood for the night. The next day at home was like every single day: Everyone was angry and rude and making me feel horrible for just existing or just ignoring each other.

I just realized that I really don't like my family. Like at all. They're all mean and know it (like say that they are) and just don't care. I mean it was like I felt unconditional acceptance for one day and my entire view of my life and the people in it changed. There was just such a juxtaposition between everything and it kinda makes me angry. I went to the house of these people I hadn't seen in years, and even then I'd only seen them a handful of times, and they treated me more like family than my own. Maybe I'm whining but I'm so tired of living like a burden every day of my life… I guess I just needed to say this somewhere because who can you even say this to?

bipolar,"Hi all. I live with Bipolar II, and it has been in remission for years. I was starting to think I had finally figured out how to live with it. Until a couple months ago. It started with uncontrollable tears. Everyday, throughout the day, for no reason. I would cry at work. In public walking my dog. In the bread aisle. I started experiencing more depression symptoms, until they stopped abruptly. I quit my job on a whim (a good job, in a great city). I wanted to see if the tears would stop if I quit work. The impulsivity only escalated from there. Hypersexuality, sleepless nights spent deep-cleaning my already very clean apartment or playing with my dog. Reading books. Writing. Everything every therapist has ever told me to do. But I couldn’t seem to de-escalate. I got a new job, quit that one after day 3. I moved back in with my parents and started another job. Two weeks ago, I got fired from that job. Haven’t been sleeping well since. I even slept with my ex supervisor (3 days after he watched me get fired). I’ve been freelancing, so I can say that I don’t feel completely useless. A huge stressor has been how am I going to explain this to the next employer? 3 jobs in 4 months? 
Today, I got into a text message argument and lost a friend. There was no reason to the argument other than I couldn’t control myself. I was aggressive and ruthless with my words. Words I now regret. There was no logical reason behind what I said. I just typed them.

bipolar,"So, I'm feeling desire for ""bad"" things. Like things I limit myself or have limits on. Because I view them as negative or that they could be detrimental to me. 

For example, I've never had a cigarette in my life, don't want to start, have sworn them off because everyone growing up chain smoked and it disgusts me. But the last few weeks I've had the thought EVERY time I go to a gas station ""maybe I should buy some cigarettes or a vape"" and I feel ashamed immediately after. Today, I wanted to buy scratch offs. Which I know aren't as bad and every year or two I will buy some, but I try not to. And there's tons of other things I desire or am slightly giving in to that aren't as ""good"" for me. Like super horny and taking risks with that. But the cigarettes and scratch offs are new thoughts. 

I'm doing good things more, too, though. Like, I've started working out a little more. I'm drinking less (at home at least). Doing more crafts, I'm finally practicing makeup and hair stuff again. I got a water drinking app that's been helping. Like still doing good things and keeping pretty consistent the last few weeks. 

But it's like my brain wants to just break every rule I have and undo any good stuff and do all these ""bad"" things. It's so frustrating. I've worked really hard my whole life to try to control, try to maintain at least decent health if no energy for really good. But like, why all of a sudden am I constantly itching for these random things? I'm feeling a bit depressed and lonely and lost lately, but am still going out and hanging and talking to friends.

These impulsive/intrusive thoughts just itch at the back of my mind. I don't know what to do or how I should feel about myself. I've also had a lot of suicidal thoughts that I've been managing so I'm wondering if maybe this is my brain trying to still self destruct because I'm not doing that. It's just making it hard to take preventive action to keep myself in a good place.

My graduation day was the most overall emotion and self-pride I’ve ever felt. I was so so supported by my family and friends. I never thought I would actually finish college. With that, I finished with a 3.6 overall GPA and 3.9 for both of my major GPAs. I find myself crying randomly because I just can’t believe I did it. In those 4.5 years, I was diagnosed with BP2, moved countries, started therapy and meds, and can finally say I’m doing good. It feels like everything I’ve done since the moment I started college has paid off, including seeking help for my mental health. Onto the next chapter… GO ME!!!!!!

Addition: my college progress was a huge indicator of my bipolar cycles before I was diagnosed. I would fail a semester, then get all A’s the next, and it was pretty clearly a distinct pattern. However, I’ve aced the past 4 semesters since being on meds. It truly has been life changing and the proof is in my consistent college performance! 

Edit: on my graduation day I felt so supported by family and friends. I didn’t really feel it up until that day.

In high school I was diagnosed with ""autism spectrum disorder,"" and the faculty staff claimed I was ""high functioning."" For years I felt so insulted and out of place with these labels, since I known people with autism for years, and I'm NOTHING like any of them. To this day I have chronic trauma from this humiliation, and my family often brings up that I'm ""on the spectrum.""

When I was in college I felt suicidal from all the college stress and I was put into psychiatric care with therapy and antidepressants. They told me I'm bipolar, everything made more sense to me. People would say I don't pick up on social skills, but knowing I had actually was suffering from manic makes more sense, as I loose focus on other things as I acted goofy.

Throughout my life, would have episodes of racing thoughts and crazy behavior, and then later would feel sheer sadness and guilt. It didn't help that special needs teachers always humiliated me in front of classmates, talking to me like I was 4 while in high school. 

As I rotated with various prescriptions with mixed results, the idea that I was bipolar and never autistic makes me more mad. I really wish that society would take bipolar more seriously rather than just labeling these people as autistic. Of course, it's always possible that autistic people can also be/develop bipolar, but for people to have the nerve to give me such labels and treat me like I'm lesser than my peers is inexcusable.

my mom (57F) and i do not get along. i see myself as a very level-headed person, while she just seems outright delusional most of the time. she always yelled at me over random unimportant things as a child. insults my appearance a lot, and overall was always hostile while I was growing up. this has caused me to resent her a lot, which is hard for me to admit. I am very irritable and rude toward her, but i'm not quite sure if the irritability is a bipolar thing or if its just because i simply do not like her. 

today, we had a huge fight. she called me out for being rude all the time, and i ended up just telling her straight-up that i resented her and listed all the things that made me resent her over the years. she denied all of it and said i was making things up, which i am not. she started crying because she couldn't handle my brutal honesty.

however, no matter how many times i try to communicate how she has made me feel, she always denies it. straight up tries to gaslight me into thinking she's never done anything wrong. but every hour she screams about something, complains, yells, freaks out over nothing. it's exhausting.

so later today, she sends me a huge text basically saying that i need to start taking meds for my bipolar because it's making me irritable and that i'm ""making mountains out of mole hills,"" which she also attributes to BD. **but honestly, i feel like she is using my recent diagnosis to dismiss my feelings and words to make her feel better about herself.** 

so i guess my question is this: **how do you differentiate between genuine emotions vs bipolar irritation/paranoia?** i know i am not paranoid about the way she has treated me because my non-BD siblings feel the same way as me about the things she has done. i feel like i'm going crazy because i feel like my emotions are not irrational considering her words and actions toward me, but her dismissal of my emotions because of my recent diagnosis is making me second guess myself. what's real and what isn't? it's all just very confusing :( any advice?

I don’t have any savings because of this, and at this point consider going to Trader Joe’s a “luxury.” I think I’m having a mixed episode. My paranoia is through the roof, I have an insatiable urge to cuss out my boss, quit mid shift, k*ll myself, and just move to a whole new city (I live in LA). This has been one of the worst years of my life and I’ve been doing everything I can to take care of myself since getting my diagnosis a couple months ago. I’ve been sober for a year and 6 months, I’m medicated, go to therapy every week, and live with my supportive and loving boyfriend— yet I feel like I’m going off the rails.

bipolar,"I am going through a really confusing time and need some support. 

I have been diagnosed Bipolar a handful of times the past decade. Along with Bipolar, I’m also diagnosed with C-ptsd, Panic Disorder, GAD, OCD, Depression, and ADHD. 

Over the past five years, I’ve tried many meds, but haven’t found my combo yet. 

I’d like to point out that I felt extremely frustrated with my first psychiatrist as she would put me on a med (Depakote for example) which would decrease my anxiety, ocd, mania but would increase my depression. Instead of putting me on an additional med to treat the depression, she would just take me off Depakote entirely. This scenario happened with multiple meds. She refused to let me take more than one. So please understand my exhaustion as I feel I should be on a combo of meds by now. 

So I see a new psychiatrist. This guy almost caused me to commit suicide. He put my on Zoloft alone and said we would add a mood stabilizer once I adjusted. I called him so many times the 3 weeks I was on Zoloft saying I was having intrusive thoughts of harming myself and he said, I kid you not, “I’ve never heard of Zoloft causing this. All of my patients have been successful on it.” This made me feel like I was crazy and I ended up at the ER. They took me off the Zoloft and sent me home. The side effects last for over a month until I rebalanced. Honestly traumatizing. 

Months later, I’m ready to try again. Next psychiatrist is actually great. He is the one that diagnosed me with ADHD which was a new one. Unfortunately my insurance changed, so I had to go to yet another psychiatrist before him and I could even get started.

So here we are at my fourth psychiatrist. She has ONE appointment with me and declares that I am not bipolar or adhd. Instead, she insists that it’s just anxiety and ptsd. She tried lithium anyway. I respond poorly. Then she puts me on an antidepressant and I got a brutal manic episode. So I stop taking that immediately before we have a repeat of the Zoloft situation. 

So now I’m afraid to see her again. We’ve had 3 appointments and at each appointment I’ve tried to desperately explain that I do have Bipolar. She won’t listen. 

Has anyone ever been diagnosed Bipolar and have a new doctor try to deny that? Or have you ever had doctors that won’t do med combos right away?

I feel like I’m never going to get the help I need.

bipolar,"Hi to whoever reads this

I am 18 and for a very long time I have shown very clear symptoms of being bipolar, and have even undergone a prolonged sort of schizoaffective or manic episode last year that had resulted in me being kicked out of school and legally required to be in therapy until I am reported no longer a danger to myself and others.

My parents think I've done all of that for attention because I've learnt how to help myself and eased my symptoms (in the sense that my episodes last shorter and do less damage to me and those around me.) In general, they deject any concept of me being mentally ill and specifically my dad claims that the reason for things like me informing school about my mental health issues for privileges such as extra examination time have all only been for pity.

Recently I cut off a friend who was extremely abusive. They weren't diagnosed but they were very clearly borderline and I was their 'FP' and when I had cut them off things went to shit when they were on their way to attempting in front of their entire family because I left, and soon my parents found out. My mom had been on my side and was very understanding of all my reasons but my dad on the other hand had said all the wrong points such as comparing my episode and theirs and saying that I had done it as a stupid mistake for pity while they deserve genuine empathy because they are mentally ill. I've truly never been more frustrated in my life because not only did this friend really destroy me and my other friends' mental health, but have they also somehow gained my dad's sympathy when I never have. Why does my dad refuse to believe me? We always withdraw from therapy before I can continue with a doctor long enough to be diagnosed, I have gone to 3-4 different doctors but each of them I'd only have a session or two with and that would always be a result of some horrible episode I had and my parents would see that since the episode is over or has calmed that I'm able to withdraw from therapy, only for me to have to be put back in again.

All my psychiatrist's notes are incomplete and all over the place. My document is so messy. I personally don't care about going to therapy because again, I've done so much for so long to make sure I can (to an extent, yes I still have insane outbursts) control my actions even if I can't control my thoughts.) and in addition to that the costs of therapy, medication, diagnosis papers are insane here. But I am so sick of this conversation topic constantly being brought up about how I want to be mentally ill and how the only thing I have is 'mental complications' in his words, because he views mental illness as an extreme. I don't get it, do I just go along with it and call myself stupid and immature like he calls me so we can just avoid this conversation? I get so sickeningly frustrated that it has sent me into extreme episodes over and over again, and I'm really scared it's making me worse again because I'm in my last year of school and just want to get it over with safely instead of having to be removed again from school premises for being a danger to myself or others, and it would be a repeated offense.",My dad never believes me,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Rant '}, {'a': ':angry-cry:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/kns090pd89za1_t5_2qnv4/angry-cry'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,7542u,-0.48776958685523125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,18,3

bipolar,"Hello, again!

I’m afraid I don’t really know how Reddit is supposed to work — I made my account only a few days ago and r/bipolar was the first community I joined.

I have always had trouble communicating ‘how I’m doing’ and I was harshly reminded of that when I met up with some old friends yesterday. My first full-blown mania was about a year ago and it was pretty clear to basically everyone who knew me at the time that I was going through something.

Naturally, my friends wanted to know how I was doing and somewhat correctly guessed that getting me drunk was the only way to get me to open up.

As you might’ve guessed, that didn’t go well, and instead of my friends feeling relieved or reassured knowing ‘what’s really going on,’ I’m afraid they just think I’m crazy or something. Nothing bad happened in particular, I was just very vague and a little morbid — I have PTSD symptoms as well and it’s very hard to talk about my mental health without hiding behind clinical jargon. I feel more separated from my friends than before, really, and I feel like such a freak. I wish I could have ‘normal’ human problems.

Anyways, I’m not letting that get me down (by and large, I’m doing quite well actually) and I wanted to share this on here to chat with other bipolar folks about this kinda stuff.

bipolar,"Hi guys....it's my first time posting. I haven't been diagnosed with bipolar but I have a feeling I might be soon and atm depression is hitting pretty hard and I would like to feel less alone.

I've always felt like two people in one. Got pretty bad depression at least once a year ever since puberty, followed by elevated mood and drive. During these ""good mood"" periods my dreams and aspirations would pull me forward. My dreams of acting, playwrighting and working in theatre in general.

About a year ago I took mdma with a friend and at first everything was fine. Until I realised it had probably triggered a severe depressive episode. I was almost completely unable to function. I would burst out crying no matter what I was doing, lost all hope etc etc.

I was put on SSRIs and it worked..i got better a lot quicker..i could feel myself become manic and decided to taper off of the meds without my GP because I thought ""i had it under control"". I didn't. Long story short, I dropped out of uni, embarassed myself, hurt a bunch of people and am in debt now.

Up until recently it was again the thought of my dreams pulling me forward. I was planning to put on a play I've written and was working towards that.

Until my depression hit me again like a truck..out of the blue, all my desire to write or work towardw my dreams has evaporated. I again feel like I'm this different person..i barely care about anything..i just wanna stay in bed.
I was visiting family and am back at the airport and to stop myself from freaking out and crying I'm thinking about how I can vape again when i've landed. It's really sad how my nicotine addiction is the thing I look forward to most right now.

I feel incredibly stupid for thinking I was healed when I was in fact manic. It makes me think all that happiness was an illusion, all my dreams were bullshit. How can I ever view anything with certainity in life? While i was manic i kept thinking ""i can't be manic, i still sleep enough"" i was so certain i was doing fine, all the while behaving completely irratic.

I feel like I can never take on responsibility in life because I tried starting a business during mania and now the thought of ever doing that makes me want to vomit from anxiety.

I'm waiting to hear back from my GP to get referred to a therapist again..until then just holding on.

I come here to the sub, and everyone here gets it, is experiencing it right here with me. And it’s a reminder that I’m not alone.

bipolar,"So I think I have always had autistic traits. It’s nothing I want to get diagnosed for, just a thing about me.

I started lithium last February (after having had bipolar 2 for 4 years). Within weeks, I’ve noticed that these traits are a lot stronger than they had previously been. I seem more autistic, to the point that a psych ward admission over the summer suggested that I have it and meet the criteria for a diagnosis (in addition to bipolar 2).

One could argue that lithium is the medication that has made me feel most like myself, and so these traits are stronger than when I was on quetiapine or aripiprazole, for example.

I am more rigid in the way I think, less able to adapt to change, more sensitive to other medications and cannot pick up on social cues at all. My partner has noticed this about me too.

I was 25 and 26 during the pandemic, and I feel that those 2 years stopped me from enjoying ""being in my 20s"". Also, birthdays have been a strange thing since I turned 19. That year, almost no one showed up when I celebrated it, so I pretty much stopped doing it. I only have a small dinner with my family and my girlfriend, and sometimes a friend. Ironically, my ""happy place"" is always when I turned 21, with my gf's head in my shoulder, my best friend in front of me, and my family around me. 

I always love to celebrate my GF's birthday in particular, and always make a point of calling everyone I care about for theirs. I don't always get the same treatment back, so that also sours me a bit, and has made me not care about it. A part of me says that it's nice to be celebrated for a day, but another part says that it's just one more day and nothing so special.

I never actually thought I'd get this far, and I still feel like I'm not doing things right and I adopted the philosophy of ""I don't know what I'm doing, but no one has stopped me so far"". 

The feeling of mortality keeps growing, and I feel like I haven't achieved everything I wanted. I've always dreamed of becoming a writer, and I keep failing to finish my stories. I can't focus for long, or keep a schedule, and it bothers me that every day it gets harder and harder to sit down and actualy type without getting distracted.

I found a perfect room with a great roommate. I’m moving out of the area and we sent each-other voice notes back and forth and FaceTimed for 2 hours. It’s an ideal situation and perfect price.

The landlord said I can rent with my pets . But bc she remembered I said I have an ESA, he asked for the letter. Now after weeks of talking I have to share my ESA letter than says I have bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.

I just sent the letter and also a long text explaining how bipolar affects me and how it won’t be an issue.

Wow, this sucks.

I said I can offer a letter of reference for my old roommate and that im happy to answer any questions I have.

bipolar,"i love being bipolar when im manic, i hate it the other 98% of the time. why cant i have something thats easier to fucking deal with????????? like if i was just depressed ALL the time at least id get USED to being depressed eventually. but these fuckin episodes... i never get used to them. it's unbearable every single fuckin time.

i haven't had a depressive episode this long or this severe in... who knows, probably over a year i guess... but rn it feels like the worst thing ive ever experienced.

for context, im between jobs right now. i have nothing to do with my life and its awful. no distractions. nothing. 

i never thought myself an alcoholic. ive been addicted to damn near everything you dont consume intravenously, and never alcohol. i could never allow myself to drink more than 2 days in a row because it makes my body feel awful. but... ive spent like 100 dollars on alcohol this week and its wednesday. ive been going through a 12 pack of beer a day plus another 6 at night and each beer is topped to the brim with vodka. cheap, disgusting vodka. i figured out that 1. if you feel like shit no matter what, a hangover isnt even a detectable difference. and 2. more alcohol usually fixes the hangover. it also makes it worse when you finally let it happen, but it puts it off for a while.  

it started because i havent slept in a while. i havent really gotten out of bed or eaten, but i havent slept either. ive never been much of an insomniac. i love sleeping, and its usually easy. ive literally never experienced this before. i used to take insane amounts of adderall to keep myself awake when i had shit to get done and even then id end up taking a nap here and there because i love sleep and i do NOT function well without it. so, i got frustrated at my inability to sleep and the only thing guaranteed to make me pass out is getting really really fucking drunk. so after 2 days of no sleep, i said fuck it. i bought an 18 pack and whipped out the shooters that have been sitting in the back of my freezer for god knows how long. and i went through the majority of the 18 pack that night... i think i set a new record for how much alcohol i can consume in a 6 hour period and live. and i didnt sleep. at all. 

so when 8 am rolled around and i was still awake i just popped another fucking bottle open. i mean, fuck it, why not? what do i have to fucking lose?

my friend gave me a lecture after a couple days of being constantly borderline blacked out and saying a bunch of stupid shit to everyone. they told me how concerning it is that im acting like this, how far theyve seen me come and how im throwing it all down the drain because im depressed. they told me they cannot bear to watch me slowly kill myself yet again. they said they worry so much, because if i die, they probably wouldnt know right away, probably not until days later, maybe weeks. they said im the one thing that stays constant in their life, and they cant bear to lose that. 

they showed up at my house yesterday. i think it was yesterday. i wasnt replying to their texts because i was ashamed about the shit i did the night before. anyways, they just walked in. they walked in and i heard my door open so i stumbled out of my room, off the bed thats stacked with empty bottles that i dont care to throw away because the trash is too full and i dont have the energy to take it out. they saw me, in week old pajamas i havent cared to change, radiating the stench of stress sweat and alcohol. and before they said anything, i opened a beer and passed it to them, an unconscious act of hospitality. then i saw the look on their face. 

it wasnt an intervention, we just talked about life. it was nice. weve been through some shit together. weve attempted together. so i have no restriction when i tell them how shit my life is going, and they listen. they always listen. i love them for that. they talked about their goals, and thats when i realized i have no goals anymore. i dont know what im doing, why im here, nothing seems to mean enough for me to commit to it anymore. i have nothing to strive for, really. ive never had an episode thats lasted this long.. since september, at least. it sucked seeing my friend, who i spent years pulling out of their own rut, doing so well... and im like this. ive disappointed them. 

i get up every morning and tell myself ""today is the day i get my shit together. today is the day i muster up the motivation to fix my shit and be better."" and then i take a bunch of stimulants to give me the motivation to get out of bed but all it gives me is heart palpitations and sore eyes. motivation for what? honestly. whats anything worth? im waiting to fuckin die. its frustrating, because life is so worth living when im not depressed and i KNOW that, but that doesnt change how i feel when i AM depressed. 

i think ive gotten 5 hours of sleep this past week. not since monday, i mean in the last 7 days. i try so hard. i turn off all my screens and sit in silence or give myself some kind of ambient background noise and then... i stare at the backs of my eyelids for hours. hours until i give up and decide to try to drug myself to sleep. and then im just awake AND on drugs and ive gained nothing and lost my sanity. 

i went through my old journals and my instagram archives looking for motivation for myself, trying to find inspiration for what i was like back when i wasnt miserable. but, what i found is that... ive always been miserable. ive been dealing with the same things for as long as i have records of it and definitely before that. i havent gotten better. ive certainly gotten worse in some ways, more severe. but never actually better. i havent changed. i dont know if i can. not because i think humans are incapable of changing, but because i personally cant keep the motivation. when im good im very good, but when im bad im better. i like doing good... till i get bored of it, or my goals lose momentum. 

a friend spent the night with me llast night. i love this friend because they dont expect anything from me, they love me just as i am, the good, the bad, and the terrible. i thought that maybe i couldnt sleep because i recently broke up with my ex and now i sleep in a cold, empty bed. i hate sleeping alone. so i thought maybe having someone with me would help. but it didnt. i just kinda embarrassed myself with my drunkenness instead. and far after they passed out, i layed awake next to them, opening beer after beer, each time topped with skol, in silence. silence and darkness. and when they woke up, i still hadnt slept, it was 11 am. they never voiced that they were concerned or disappointed or anything, but i was disappointed. theres no good reason for me to burden all my friends with my dysfunction. theres no reason to make them worry about me. i mean, im not suicidal or anything, i dont really have the option to be. im not gonna die, im just being terrible for the time being. 

i havent eaten in a while. my body doesnt want to eat. everything looks disgusting, nauseating. the only thing it wants is more alcohol. i cant do that to myself. i cant. i also cant afford to, financially. but i wake up and i feel like shit and the only thing that makes feeling like shit tolerable is alcohol. 

i was invited to a new years party. i was told to ""please not fuck with the vibes"". dont know how thats gonna happen, but id rather spend my new year away from my disgusting house. ill probably end up getting kicked out of the party. maybe thatll be my wake up call or something. but everything i think will be a wake up call or a new low or fucking whatever just ends up turning into another day, another fuck up. life may or may not go on. its fine. 

life would be cool if meds worked, but it kinda wouldnt, because the constant reminder that i need a cocktail of pills to force myself into normalcy is my own personal nightmare. ill take my drugs voluntarily to get high, thank you very much. plus, i build tolerance too fast. i end up on the max dose of a medication within a year of starting it, and they all just stop working after a while. whats the point in taking meds if theyre not gonna work forever, or even a significant amount of time?  

i guess its gonna be another day with no sleep, thats how its feeling anyways. i wish i felt tired. i wish i felt anything human. i feel like that story ""the girl from the other side"". i feel like ive been touched by an outsider and im slowly losing everything that makes me human. i mean, i dont even enjoy anything anymore. literally anything. the friend who spent the night last night brought their fancy drawing tablet to try to motivate me to put my emotions into art like i used to. it didnt work. i have no motivation or inspiration to create. i want to sleep. 

every time i go through a depressive episode i think its the worst one yet, but in all reality, theyre always terrible, just in different ways. i wish i knew which type of terrible an episode was gonna be so i could prepare myself for it. 

i wanna clean my house before the new year, i know itll help me. shitty external environment means shitty internal environment. cleaning always helps, i just wish i wasnt too tired to do it. i havent folded my laundry in 4 months.

i suppose im asking for advice, or support, or understanding, or... anything, really.

bipolar,"Hi yall

I’ve dealt with depression since my teens but was officially diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2020.

The holidays usually aren’t too terrible for me (26F), but this year has been the worst by far. Both of my parents have passed in the last 7 years and I dont have family by me. I have a partner, but he isn’t big into the holidays. Pretty tight money wise right now, so couldn’t celebrate if we wanted to. 

I haven’t taken my meds since Friday. I usually take them to work with me so I don’t forget to take them, but then I sometimes don’t take them over the weekends because they’re in my work bag, and out of sight out of mind. That’s what happened this weekend. Usually it doesn’t impact me too much. 

Well Christmas Day I had the darkest thoughts I’ve ever had. Thinking (mid-hug) that my partner would enjoy this potential last memory of us together. Stopped myself from crying so he wouldn’t know I was struggling. Convinced myself that I shouldn’t reach out for help because it’s about time I do something for myself and that I wouldn’t be around for the worst part anyway. Etc. pretty shitty thoughts. 

I happened to have taken an edible (legal here) an hour or so before all of that and it put me to sleep, so nothing happened.

Yesterday I woke up feeling just about the same. Not as scary of thoughts, though. Went to work and went back home within an hour because of how depressed I was feeling. Called off today for the same feelings.

As of right now I’m still feeling depressed, but I don’t want to take my meds. I know it’s not unusual to not want to take them. I know they would fix it. But damn I don’t want to. 

I dont want to tell anyone I didn’t take them. I’ll just look like a failure and a dumbass because I’m not doing the one thing that could literally save my life. I hate this feeling more than I can describe. 

As of right now I don’t want to start my meds back up again. I’d rather end up at the hospital or something. I don’t think I’m being logical. I don’t know what to do.

bipolar,"I’m currently feeling what I am assuming is the opposite of disassociation?

Instead of feeling disconnected from everything and like I’m watching myself from outside my own body, I’m hyper-aware that I’m very much in a body, that I have blood flowing through me, of everything that is touching my skin as I lay in bed. I can feel my eyeballs sitting in my skull and I can’t help but notice the feeling of my eyelids sliding over my eyes when I blink or close my eyes when I try to go to sleep. When my eyes are closed, I feel the weight of my eyelids. Every noise happening in my house sounds like it’s clear as day and I’m distinctly aware of each different one. I don’t feel numb the way I do when I disassociate, I feel almost panicked because everything just feels intensely real.

bipolar,"Hi All,

Hoping to get some feedback, sorry for the essay. 

I had an incident today where a pharmacist denied me my meds. My prescriber sent them in early with a note that I can get them early to avoid problems with the holiday. Insurance ok’d it, no big deal. I called yesterday to confirm with the pharmacy, “all good they’ll be ready tomorrow.” Went to pick them up, she said “you should have plenty. I’m not filling it 5 days early. Come back when it’s three days early.” I said I’m sorry but my doctor and insurance cleared it, I don’t understand. She said well I’m personally not going to fill it because you’re being argumentative. I pulled out my phone, recorded the whole thing, argued without being unkind, and left. I absolutely pointed out that Kroger has no right to come between me, my prescriber, and my insurance. Fell on deaf ears, and they called my doc who asked me to come in. 

I was upset at the interaction not because it was an inconvenience, but because in my head that irresponsible behavior is the same that can kill, or like the stories you hear about a sexual assault victim who is denied Plan B by a pharmacist when she leaves the ER. 

I know that Pharm. D’s have that power. It’s just never happened to me, and seemed so preposterous that I just stood there with the store manager and the pharmacist asking to please explain why. Again, she said “I’m personally not doing it because you are being argumentative.”

I went to the doc, and felt pretty ashamed because I didn’t have the foresight to realize she was going to be pulled into it. My therapist came in too and just looked disappointed. They were both just worried that my mania was kicking up and were not upset in the slightest. I apologized, left, and feel horrible. 

Mania for me is difficult because I’m usually the last to find out I’m in it. But now I’m in this merry-go-round of ok so do I never call people out when they violate my values and principals? Is this just mania or maybe a combo of onset and poor judgement?

Do I just go on practicing letting go because I can’t tell the difference between standing up for myself and losing control?

Sorry for the rant. I don’t know how to make this up to anyone besides just staying off their radars for a while. Definitely not apologizing to the pharmacist….

“Psychosis is a condition of the mind that results in difficulties determining what is real and what is not real. Symptoms may include delusions and hallucinations, among other features. Additional symptoms are incoherent speech and behavior that is inappropriate for a given situation. There may also be sleep problems, social withdrawal, lack of motivation, and difficulties carrying out daily activities. Psychosis can have serious adverse outcomes.”",Do or have you experienced Psychosis?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion '}, {'a': ':nervous:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/v9pgzsvbd9za1_t5_2qnv4/nervous'}]",r/bipolar,0.4617153355686271,-0.049503811660505735,-0.049503811660505735,0,1,0,0,0,InsomniaKush,0.355034842987008,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,3

bipolar,"I'd been very stable for about five years on my meds, with diagnoses of PTSD, ADHD, depression and anxiety. But I felt TOO stable, very flat, so about a month and a half ago, my psych put me on the antidepressant Viibryd.

I thought I was doing fantastically, honestly. In my job, I felt so motivated to get better in my field, especially since I had just received a negative performance evaluation--I felt like I finally had the willpower and drive to perform superbly at my job. Personally, I finally felt driven to get my life together--make that dentist appointment, make a budget, organize my apartment, get different things I'd been procrastinating on DONE. 

Sure, I was feeling paranoid. My thoughts were racing and even though I wanted to research more about my field, I couldn't organize my thoughts well enough to make any headway. I was agitated beyond belief, getting enraged at my brother (whom I share an apartment with) almost daily. The medication was giving me nightmares, and I couldn't sleep for more than two hours before waking up in a cold sweat, terrified. 

But I could work a full eight hours without getting tired! I stood up for myself in a situation in which I would normally have just stuck my head in the ground! I felt happy in my personal life and engaged at work...

This past Friday, my psych diagnosed me with Bipolar II. The Viibryd had kicked off a hypomanic episode. I had to stop the Viibryd immediately and start on the antipsychotic Vraylar, tapering off of the Abilify I'd been on.

I have a 10-day break from work, thank God, because otherwise I don't know how I'd cope. I'm okay in the mornings, but by the afternoons, I am a sobbing wreck. I feel such a sense of loss. I had so many dreams that felt so close and so real, if only for a couple of weeks. I felt like I had so many problems in my life, but I was finally energetic and driven enough to tackle them successfully. I felt like I knew what I actually wanted to do with my life, further myself in this field, instead of thinking about other fields or career paths I could be on. I felt confident I could handle life, for the first time in a decade. 

And now it's all...gone. I'm back to where I was before. Well, worse--when I stabilize again, I'll probably feel flat; able to handle life, but just barely, and forget about truly *enjoying* it. I won't get ahead on my responsibilities like I felt I might have been able to while hypomanic. I'll continue to slowly drown in financial ruin and just plain ol' apathy about life. I won't make any dreams come true, not only because I'll be too apathetic, but also because I don't even know what my dreams are anymore. 

How do you bounce back from this? I guess understanding my experience as being ""bipolar"" is new to me--I guess I feel like what I'm feeling right now is my new reality, when it's really ""just"" a depressive episode. I just feel like I'm grieving the future I thought I might have, that I thought Viibryd was giving me, that was really just hypomanic, anxious energy. And now, looking back, what I thought was two years of happiness in college, followed by two years of depression, was likely just bipolar symptoms. Maybe my ""happiness"" in college never really was.

bipolar,"I went to my doctors office today, and I was talking to this nurse about the bipolar/borderline/schizophrenia grouping of disorders (she seemed to be a bit uneducated as to the differences). She was telling me about a son of a family friend who has schizophrenia who heard voices telling him to stop taking his meds, and when he complied it went about like one would expect. She then compared him to me, someone with bipolar 2 who was lucky enough to get meds which really helped and who happens to also be in grad school. She was obviously trying to be very nice, but I kinda felt like she was making a “oh but you are one of the good ones” argument with me, and that made me hella uncomfortable. I tried to gently educate her that everyone has their own hurdles, and that while bipolar and schizophrenia are cousins, they are like 3rd cousins at closest, so comparing me and him is not exactly an apples to apples comparison, not to mention the million other variables.

While this was probably one of the most blatant times this has happened to me, it was far from the only time.

bipolar,"The most common post I see here is from people with Bipolar disorder disbelieving their diagnoses and wanting to cease their medications. I feel it needs to be stated here, as my own psychiatrist told me: 

People with Bipolar often, if not always, have a period of time when they disbelieve their diagnosis. It can be due to a prolonged period of stability, a long period of depression, or even caused by mania or hypomania, though all cases mentioned have different causes. For one stable, they may have forgotten the dehabilitating symptoms of the manic and depressive episodes they experienced. For those manic, we can be influenced by feelings of invincibility and lose touch with reality. And for depression, it can start to feel like there are no ups, only downs, so how could you have Bipolar.

- set to lead the group as I’m a trained and experienced facilitator and have access to places for our meetups that are private and relaxed.

I’m on meds and I’m in therapy but am just starting to realise this is something I can work on and improve, where as prior I thought it’s just who I was.

While relatively stable most of the time relationships are a big hazard for me. I’ve done and seen it all so to speak but unfortunately have not managed to have a long term relationship.

My meds are ok, but I’m not sure they are working properly because when it comes to relationships I just fall apart even though the rest of my life is pretty ok…and in therapy I’ve looked at the relationship itself but not so much my negative thought patterns and childhood issues around relationships.

bipolar,"before i begin i would just like to clarify that i am not looking for a diagnosis here, i am asking if it is possible to be manic (not hypomanic) for less than 7 days. please read all the information i have given for the best understanding of the situation. 

i (19 F) am not diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but have recently have had several incidents where i was experiencing what i can only assume is a manic episode. i have severe memory loss of these episodes and even the days and weeks surrounding them. i had one that lasted for i think 6 days and ended up with me in the hospital having to be sedated because i hadn’t slept in 6 days and would not calm down. the most recent one lasted about 4-5 days and subsided naturally on its own. 

i am currently diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, PTSD, Borderline Personality Disorder, and Oppositional Defiance Disorder. i’ve had these diagnoses for years.

i also in my research found that i have been exhibiting some of the physical symptoms of bipolar as well. for starters, i wet the bed as a child until i was about 12 or 13 and had to wear pull ups every night, i have a facial tic that i’ve had since elementary school, i’ve struggled with both insomnia and hypersomnia my whole life, with the hypersomnia being the most severe in high school. something that really stuck out to me is the exaggerated startle response. i could never figure out why i’m so “jumpy” and usually yell or scream if someone talks suddenly or makes a sudden movement or noise. as well as those things i also grind my teeth, especially during these episodes. 

now here is what i am confused about; in my research, it says that in order to be diagnosed with bipolar 1, you have to have had a manic episode lasting for at least 7 days or more. for bipolar 2 its 2 weeks. none of my episodes have lasted longer than 6 days. in my opinion, my episodes are too severe to be hypomania like some of you might suggest. i can provide more details about my episodes if needed.  

so does anyone have any ideas about what is going on? i plan on seeing a psychiatrist of course but i want to hear some insight from people who have first hand experience. let me know what you think. feel free to ask any questions you have about my episodes or anything else. any and all opinions are welcomed and appreciated. thanks!","i suspect i’m bipolar, but i have some questions","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,-2.8807402672472198,-0.3041643551042889,-0.3041643551042889,0,1,1,0,0,Even_Independence889,-0.38663305527416253,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,5,6

bipolar,Hello. Recently I got diagnosed with bipolar depression. Just blankly like that. I didn’t even ask if I’m bipolar 1 or 2. I just accepted it and accepted being put on lurasidone 20mg on top of already being on lamotrigine 200mg and propranolol 20mg. I guess where I’m coming from is what is bipolar depression should I be diagnosed with bipolar 1 disorder or 2 ? Or is bipolar depression it’s seperate thing?

bipolar,"Well, I don’t think I’m the first to say this but… this sucks. It’s really hard for me to tell other people that I’m bipolar (I got diagnosed in 2020). 

I live with my mom right now (temporarily until school starts up again), and I try to act so different so she can’t see through me. Something to also mention, my mom has been working as a therapist for about 5-10 years. I’m not sure it’s been so long.. anyways I think she can tell though?? I’ve never told my mom of my diagnosis, I’ve only told my sister and brother. 

How do people just tell other people about their diagnosis? Or how do they even open up about this?

Today, I got into a mini argument with my sister (via text). Now she’s not talking to me, and I always blame myself. This is my fault right? My fault that I haven’t been going to see my psychiatrist, or that I stopped taking my medication. Maybe if I tired harder to do it, my dad, sister, and brother would start talking to me again. Maybe it’s just me wishing on a once in a lifetime thing.

My rant for today, I hate myself and I blame this disorder. Maybe… I try to think, I don’t have it. It’s hard to admit to myself also. I feel like it’s like a sickness, like the flu. It’ll go away, and nobody will know. . .  Anyone feel this way ?

bipolar,"Due to my history with bipolar disorder I have been having issues gauging when other people are being unreasonable or manipulative towards me. I'll wonder how much of it is them and whether it is somehow me and my illness even though I'm stable and have been (minus manageable depression this year) for some time. It led to most of the negativity in my life this year and the low level depression off and on throughout. When I told my partner this, he said it reminded him of  ""Chapel perilous"" when people wonder **whether some course of events was affected by a supernatural force, or was a product of their own imagination.** I thought this was a funny way to think about it. Does anyone else struggle with this and how do you cope? This year doubting my instincts and perceptions of a coworkers behavior led to me being manipulated, taken advantage of and disrespected. I want to trust myself and stick up for myself more in the new year. I'm proud of taking care of myself to the point where my life is manageable and I can be good to the people I love. What do you do? 

On medication I also struggle with recognizing normal depression, its not the black hole it used to be but it still sucks. If I'm sleeping &gt;4 hr/night, and still having an appetite with no psychosomatic pains is it really depression?

bipolar,"Hello everyone, 26(m), I am writing this post to seek support because yesterday I left my psychiatry appointment 15 minutes earlier than scheduled following a heated discussion about my concern with one of the notes she made on myChart.

For some context I was hospitalized for mania and diagnosed with bipolar/psychotic features in October 2021 due to the hallucinations and delusions I was experiencing at the time. I got released from the hospital while still manic and without any medication and my situation only got worse. I got in a fight in January 2022 while in psychoses(thankfully nobody was seriously hurt) and was arrested as a result. It was an extremely traumatizing event but thankfully as far as legal charges go I was found not guilty by reason of insanity in May of 2023.

I started treatment with my current psychiatrist/provider in February of 2022 because getting treatment was one of the conditions of my release from jail that was ordered by the court. I complied and quickly enrolled in treatment despite still being manic and paranoid in general. At the start of my treatment, my psychiatrist was immensely helpful. She put me on abilify which worked wonders and in just about 1 short month I was no longer experiencing any major manic symptoms. However, and I'm sure most of you all know how the story goes next, I felt a strong sense of embarrassment and shame about my manic episode and fell into a deep depression as result.

This is where one of my key issues with my psychiatrist began. Over the course of my treatment since February 2022, I've been on 8 different medications, and am currently on a total of 5. I experienced exponential weight gain after starting some of the medications she put me on which only further plummeted by self-esteem as I use to always be a person who was in ""good shape"". I feel strongly that I have been overmedicated and there are 2 medications I am on in particular that have had some significant side effects and that didn't seem to present any net positive benefit to the table. I've been expressing my concern about being overmedicated for the entirety of this year to no avail. My concerns have fallen on deaf ears and the usual response of my psychiatrist to me bringing up these concerns is to simply INCREASE the dosages of the various medications I am on, which has only exacerbated my weight gain and intensified my feelings of depression and anxiety.

Now that brings us to my appointment with my psychiatrist yesterday. I already felt prior to this meeting that there was a great deal of dissonance between us and I never feel any connection with what she says. I have many times left my appointments more stressed than when I got there because of something she said and I've vented to my mom plenty of times about how much she stresses me out. Before going to my appointment, I had read a note on myChart that said something to the affect ""Person's sleep schedule is inconsistent at his choosing and he has no motivation to change it."" I read this thinking to myself: ""I choose to be unable to sleep at night? I choose to be depressed and have racing thoughts?"". Bothered by the note, I decided I would ask my psychiatrist at the appoint what she meant by that. However, when I attempted to do so, instead of explaining what she meant, she accused me of being a nittpicker and started to loudly assert that she wasn't going to change the note(I never asked her to change the note btw). When I tried to ask a second time what she meant by that note, she very loudly said ""This appointment is going to end. Can we have this appointment? Or this appointment is going to end."" When she said a second time that the appointment was going to end I was so frustrated I stood up and said ""alright, see ya"" and I got up and left. 

The wrenching ordeal wasn't over quite yet though because about 40 minutes later I got a call from my psychiatrist and she began to insinuate that my ""attitude and antagonistic behavior"" was probably due to the recent increase in my wellbutrin(a medication which has helped me lots btw). I told her that's impossible because I never picked up the new dosage to begin with because my insurance didn't cover it, to which she said ""Well don't pick up the new one because it could cause more 'irritable mood'"". So in other words, she tried to attribute our disagreement to one of my medications. Apparently people with bipolar aren't allowed to disagree with someone without being suspected of being off their meds or on the wrong med. I've just absolutely had enough and do not feel comfortable seeing her at all. There are other providers/psychiatrists at the place I go to but I'm so afraid to ask about changing because I'm scared they'll say no. Not sure how to handle this situation. Has anyone else requested to change to a different psychiatrist before? If so, how did the staff/organization react to your request? Any advice and tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all and sorry for the book. I'm just in a very depressed mood right now and don't know where to turn. I feel so overwhelmed.

bipolar,"Homelessness at 23 years old traumatized me forever

I had a psychotic episode and went homeless for a few months during winter in Canada. One night, there was one man that saw me asleep at the atm in the bank and began talking to me. At first he was helpful and curious about my life. Then he began verbally abusing me for 30 minutes to an hour. Non stop yelling, saying I’m a meth head, crack addict, etc. and it got to the point that I started to believe him. I’m not lying, I actually began believing I was a crackhead because he pounded the idea into my brain with his yelling. Then he gave me two five dollar bills and went off. 


Every other interaction with any human was just as negative. Be it a police officer, a random customer offering to buy me food, or a security guard escorting me out .

I never felt empathy from the strangers I met. Even the ones buying me food did it out of their own desire to highlight their self image, it was so obvious. The police officers looked at me like another opportunity to trap a person into jail for as long as possible. The police would smile in my face while they say I looked like shit or that my eyes are dilated so much that I’m obviously on drugs when I wasn’t on drugs at all. 

Civilians never interacted with me. They only did so when they asked me to leave their property and they’d do it with no sense of humanity just a cold and short demand for me to get out of here. That was their words, get. out. of here.

bipolar,"Hi everyone, mobile post so sorry for formatting issues.

I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 during an extremely destructive hypomanic episode in September and October. Since around late October has definitely been a low, but the past week or two have been unusual and I wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar.

Last Monday I slept for an entire 24hrs and spent the days after that sleeping probably 20 hours a day and involuntarily ruminating for any of the time I spent awake. This Tuesday I stayed up for a full night and was energized the next day on top of noticing that the rumination had stopped. The next day, a fter another night of staying up I was wired until my body forced me asleep.

Since then, it feels like I've been contradicting myself to the point I worry I made it all up. I've been ruminating again but also have moments of energy where I make plans to do things that I later have no interest in. My energy levels are all over the place and I don't know how to even name the state I'm in.

bipolar,"So, I recently had a hypomanic episode and I'm pretty sure it just ended, but I'm having a few really severe symptoms still. The biggest issue is severe hypersexuality, to the point where I can no longer function at work. There doesn't seem to be any trigger because I won't even be having sexual thoughts and it'll just happen. And it lasts for hours on end and becomes agony.

A major issue is I no longer can walk comfortably because of it. Any sort of walking aggravates it, which is why working and doing physical stuff is becoming so difficult. And another issue is I have terrible restlessness as well. I can't stand still for longer than five seconds most of the time and feel the need to pace nearly constantly.

So these two symptoms will aggravate each other and get so intense that it's impossible to focus and work. My mom thinks I might still be in an episode if my functioning is impaired but I'm not sure because I haven't had elation in a while. And also it's strange because hypomanic episodes have never impaired my functioning before and were usually very mild.

I should say I've got a therapist and psychiatrist appointment scheduled but I still have a week before one of them and longer for the other. But do any of you have things that might work and get rid of the unwanted arousal, or at least a way to tolerate the sensation. It's getting the point where I'll break down crying because it's so uncomfortable.

Lastly, I will say I've tried the obvious thing to do to avoid saying anything really inappropriate. It does not work for longer than two minutes.

bipolar,"It first started when I was a teen in 2004 and was having a major depressive episode for 2 years because I wasn't really happy with the new high school. I was failing in all my courses in my second year of high school due to severe cognitive decline and memory issues retaining what I studied. I had to drop out for 2 years. 

That's around the time when I went on a week long vacation with friends in summer 2005 and had a blast and my moods turned to manic those days. My brother had to come down to supervise me because of my erratic behaviour. I was misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder because the expensive psychiatrist I went to met me while I was severely depressed and couldn't express myself and she couldn't figure it out. 

I think that vacation saved me though because I found my first love in my manic state. She was nurturing and helped through the 4.5 years we were together. I was full of life for a while and managed to pass my high school exams somehow. I was intermittently depressed again during the first year with my new girlfriend but she was supportive and I made it all the way through college without depression. I've always been a bit excitable and people just thought of me as a little crazy in college which I now realise was because of BP. I had a good time all through college without getting manic though.

I didn't have any symptoms from when I started college in 2006. I finished college with good grades, got a good job in business research soon after college where I was a top performer and was rapidly promoted, had ambition. I went to The Netherlands to do my master's in 2014.

Christmas 2014 I was backpacking through Europe with friends and was full of joy in those days and that's what triggered my mania but I managed to get back to my university town somehow alone and in mania. I was getting progressively manic over the next month and was left unsupervised in a foreign country. I had a very severe manic episode and the police had to get me hospitalised. I was involuntarily admitted by a magistrates order for 4 months. In another country with better mental healthcare that I wouldn't have got back home, I feel I was lucky even though I had to drop out of University and didn't get a chance to complete my studies.

2015 went by with severe cognitive decline. I slept 16 hours. I couldn't read or talk much but met with few friends daily, smoked some weed and chilled for the next two years recovering. I wasn't as bright as before so I managed to get a less demanding job in a bank doing business development. Sadly I was laid off because I was underperforming and haven't held a job since 2017 because I was getting intermittent mild hypomanic mood swings.

The next 3 years were completely stable I read 50 books a year, listened to a lot of music, did many online courses for 2 years which didn't help me get a job however. But I was content because I felt normal then.

I moved states during the pandemic in 2020 and had another severe manic episode mid 2021 was hospitalised in October for over a month and again had cognitive decline and was still a bit manic but not severe for a few months after discharge. During my recovery I again began sleeping 16 hours. I meditated for 4 hours a day during my recovery which helped out a lot in giving me some peace and satisfaction.

Sadly I broke off contact with most of my friends during that time because I couldn't get myself to get in touch and not many friends got in touch with me either. I did manage to keep a handful close friends though they don't live near me. I managed to make just one new friend in the place I'm at now and go out once in a while. Ihope I find new friends, I used to be more sociable

I only felt my normal self 6 months ago but the hypersomnia continues. I feel hopeful about 2024 though and plan to read more books like before, go out to the beach during the day which I find improves my mood and be content in life. I just hope I find someone who is understanding and accepting of me when the time is right.",My bipolar story,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Story '}, {'a': ':reading:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/4tbk47jia9za1_t5_2qnv4/reading'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,FomalhautPeacekeeper,-0.48776958685523125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,16,5

bipolar,"The struggle of being Trans and Bipolar

I don't feel like people talk enough about how dysphoria can be triggering for a Trans person with bipolar disorder.

I don't speak for everyone in this post, I'm just reporting what MY experience is like as a bipolar trans person. 

It's literally a roller coaster. When I'm in hypomania, gender euphoria is frequent, well, until it isn't anymore and I decline very quickly into depression and in a very intense way. Sometimes it's a characteristic I notice in a person of a biological gender that I know I'll never have, or when I see that clothes don't fit me the way they do on cis people. Events like being called by pronoun are also a big trigger, and this simply derails me into episodes of external depression. 

My depression is usually very quiet, I keep getting up, doing basic everyday things, but I live in total apathy. I sleep too much at the same time that I don't sleep at all and I become a really quiet person.

But the depression caused by dysphoria is too explosive and sudden, very, very unstable. The slightest slip makes me burst into anger or start crying, I start to hallucinate about my own body and I have broken at least three mirrors when I see my reflection. 

As I said, I'm just telling you my experience. But if a person without the disorder already suffers considerably from gender dysphoria, a bipolar person can have much worse reactions to It.
If anyone feel the same, or relate to this, please tell me. I really don't want to feel alone in this anymore.",The struggle of being Trans and Bipolar,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion '}, {'a': ':nervous:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/v9pgzsvbd9za1_t5_2qnv4/nervous'}]",r/bipolar,-0.3341074270065742,-0.009294252169382074,-0.009294252169382074,0,1,0,0,0,No_Anything_1999,-0.21807216930571469,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,20,5

bipolar,"Hi all! 

I’m 18 and was diagnosed with autism about 6 months ago. 
Just under a year before I was diagnosed with bipolar. 

However, since my autism diagnosis I and my family began doubting my bipolar diagnosis as it was not diagnosed by a specialised bipolar psychiatrist, but an eating disorder psychiatrist (as I was under his care at the time due to anorexia) 

I am now 18 and have a new psychiatrist. I was wondering if anyone knows about the crossover between the two, or with ADHD and bipolar (as my father has ADHD and I feel that may be more fitting)

Further, my experience with antipsychotic medication (for bipolar) was somewhat subpar, I experienced adverse reactions and hyper sensitivity to extremely small doses - this could however be as autistic people do react more sensitively to medication.

bipolar,"Hi all, 

I am F(29) bipolar II amongst other things, I just got out of the psych hospital a week ago today for treatment for my depression. 

In the hospital I began to feel much better and was so happy to feel good again after such a long time. 

However, that lasted for maybe 5 days until things started to slip and I feel like tonight I am falling FAST. This depression has just kicked my ass again and again for sooooo long now I just can't stop thinking that I can't live like this. Surely I deserve more than 5 days feeling good within months of being depressed? I need more of a reprieve! 

The horrible thing about my depression is that no one really sees it except myself and the professionals I work with (who ask the right questions and I feel safe with). No one would believe how shit I feel right now if they saw me laughing and joking with friends earlier today, however, they don't see me bawling on the car ride home or for the rest of the evening at home.

bipolar,"Sorry for the long post but… September 27th, 2023 the day before my moms 48th birthday is the day my life fell apart. 

I barelyyyy graduated college in December 2022 with my bachelors after failing out of pt school and my mom and stepdad were so proud of me because I was the first bachelors degree college graduate in the family. I struggled to get a job but I finally got a job at a sketchy life insurance company that I quit 6 months later because it was a terrible job that took advantage of the elderly black community.  I got another job instantly after quitting and even got a large pay increase, even though I was burnt out on the industry I kept pushing. 

On a random Tuesday morning I woke up to 50 missed calls from my family. The man who raised me had a heart attack (51 m) and was in the hospital. I rushed to the hospital at 4:30 am (1 hr away) swerving through traffic and driving way faster than I should have. Once I got to the hospital there were 20+ of our close family members in the cardiac intensive care unit lobby. 

I didn’t feel like it was a huge deal, after all people have heart attacks all the time right? And he’s only 51, what’s to worry? My stepdad was a proud man he never admitted he was in pain or had any problems, he had a heart attack the week before and the day before his massive heart attack that put him into the hospital. 

When I saw him for the first time I broke down. The severity and gravity of the situation hit me like a freight train. I knew it was serious when I saw all the machines hooked up to him. I felt the helpless child that I overcame being come rushing back into me. 

To save you the gruesome stories, we ended up spending 4 days in the ICU in our first hospital and 27 in the second hospitals ICUs and went through dozens of surgeries and 100+ Vtacs ( basically afib on steroids ) and cpr and defibs. We basically watched him nearly die over 50 times each, sometimes together.  My mom and i slept in the hospital every night. We constantly stood guard over him and took day and night shifts so that someone was always with him. We took notes on procedures and medications and recorded every nurse and doctor so that we could look back and understand what’s going on. We slept in small chairs and very uncomfortable mini couches (and sometimes the floor) in the ICU lobby but we were so drained that anything worked for us. We legitimately spent more time in the ICU than any other nurse or doctor did in October. We fought so hard to make sure that we supported and cared for him to the fullest possible way. 

We ended up having to pull life support because we had maxed out every life support machine they had and 5+ doctors agreed there was no hope. It was so hard and by far the worst thing I’ve ever experienced. 

Now I’m crushed. This man raised me after my bio father abandoned me. I never showed him the love he deserves. He left my mom and I enough money to live comfortably for the rest of our lives but I can’t help but feel like I’ve been shot in the stomach with a shot gun  and I’m holding my organs in with my hands while I slowly bleed out. 

I’ve drank and gotten high every day since he passed 10/23/23 just to not feel some of the pain. I know it’s a problem but it’s the only thing that doesn’t make me feel the excruciating pain of feeling like I lost the most important battle of my life and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

Everything reminds me of what I’ve went through. Whenever I see a black Chevy truck I can’t help but wonder if that’s his truck. Anything slightly medical reminds me of the time i spent in the ICU. I can’t get him out of my head he’s all I think about.

bipolar,"So, I was diagnosed with Bipolar I when I was 16 and that has carried me since. I was then diagnosed with a plethora of other mental illnesses, but let’s just chalk it all down to the BPD/CPTSD. But here’s my issue. And I’m not in denial, just confused. 
I’m 25 now and from 16-25 i was on a steady dose of some type of antipsychotic/mood stabilizer. I only ever responded decently to Lamictal, Pristiq, and Abilify. But I still had so many symptoms and I never felt like they ever helped. I never responded well to SSRIs. I was diagnosed with Bipolar I due to the behaviors I exhibited when taking an SSRI… that’s it. I work in mental health and have been through a lot of therapy and that just doesn’t seem like a fair way to diagnose someone. I have been told by different doctors I don’t have bipolar and others that I do. I have never felt like I’ve related to the bipolar symptoms as much as I do with my BPD. Like I don’t ever feel “manic” (at least since I’ve been 21). I have gone on benders after a traumatic event, but that’s my trauma response from the bpd and cptsd.  Because currently I’m on 300mg of Wellbutrin and this is the best thing I’ve ever taken, and I’ve tried A LOT of different drugs.

I did go off medication last year, with the agreement and supervision of my doctor, and did very well for about 6 months until some pretty traumatic stuff happened. But I got the help I needed almost immediately. I went off of it again after about 6 months, again with agreement and supervision. I now am only on Wellbutrin and that’s only for helping my ADHD and BED symptoms. It did help with some of the depression I was having. But like I am stable without medications and don’t typically have symptoms?

bipolar,"Hello friends,

 Im here to share my story with anyone who might have been through something similar. I started getting treated for bipolar around 2-3 years ago but I recently had my first psychotic manic episode. This was a episode in which I accused my dad of SAing me in my sleep and got people involved.

 I also got back together with my ex etc.. My self destructive behavior led me to our local hospital that has it's own mental health unit. This is when my episode turned more psychotic and all the sudden I was in jail. This isn't who I am at all, I did lose a friend over it though. My ex's friend started spreading MY story to people that I went to school with not even relaying my trauma.

 Needless to say I have the hardest time leaving the house in my small town. My ex's friend works at the main grocery store in my town and so does a lot of the kids from my high school. Every time I go in there I see people who I know know about my situation. Im posting this so people know they aren't alone.

I thought I would be able to get my tires fixed in time for my next shift, but due to the holidays, I had to call off day of. My boss was pretty upset with me even though I followed all protocols. Following that up, I worked like normal the next day, but today I tested positive for covid.

bipolar,"I've spent my life with what I thought was just a short fuse. I'm 41 and I was diagnosed as bipolar maybe 3 months ago. After a lifetime of sucking it up and doing what needed to be done, I finally realized I had a problem. The problem I realized, was alcoholism. I quit drinking because I got so drunk I fell asleep on the floor of the kitchen. My 16 year old daughter took a picture and as it turns out a picture really is worth a thousand words. There's a lot of stories and ones that are probably much worse, but that was the one that did it for me. That was September of 2022 and I haven't drank since.

 I came to realize (with the help and support of my wife and kids) that I needed more help than just quitting drinking. It seems I've been self medicating for so long I convinced myself everything was fine. It's not. It hasn't been for a long time. 

I started my mental health journey, and after a couple of incorrect diagnoses, I found out I'm bipolar. It actually makes perfect sense. The things I've read feel like they're being written specifically about me. It's wild. The realization is almost indescribable. I'm taking meds now and all things considered I finally feel... better?...Normal? I'm not really sure. Different. Not perfect, and far from better, but different. 

Today was a bad day though. I woke up angry. Angry doesn't feel like it does justice to the absolute blinding rage I feel. The notable part is that I knew it was happening. That didn't change anything about my mood, but it did give me the clarity to tell the people around me that I feel this way. I've spent the day trying to stay away from everyone. I don't want to start yelling and snapping and being an inexplicable asshole in general. I'm not sure when it ends. I don't think I have ever actually noticed it to this extent before. 12 hours later and I'm still furious. I don't want to talk to anyone or be around anyone in general. The thought of other people actually pisses me off. 

So is there a light at the end of the tunnel? I would say yes. I'm not ""fixed"" or ""better"" or whatever, but I'm starting to see things that I haven't before, and for me, that's a light. While my current mood is rage filled with an underscore of bummed out, I'm actually hopeful that one day I won't need to figure out how to cope, because it won't be happening.

bipolar,"Bipolar diagnosed with several other things, along with borderline personality disorder. I think I’ve been manic for about a week. But it is confusing because if certain stressors aren’t there/get resolved then I stop feeling stressed with racing thoughts/angry. So I can never tell if I’m having a bipolar problem, a bpd problem, or if struggling with both of them at the same time. But everyday for the past week and a half, I’ve been dealing with lots of stress and intense anger. I can barely communicate/talk right/can’t understand simple things—it feels like I forgot how to talk/communicate sometimes lately. 

I am afraid to ask for help and possibly get admitted. I am working towards getting more or full custody of my son since the living situation is bad at his dad’s (I’m too stressed out to talk about it, and I’m not one of those parents that just wants to take my son away from his dad just because). I do not have any family within a 4 hour radius. Even if I did live close to anyone, I’m not close to any of them and I do not think I’d want my son in any of their care (this is a thought/belief I have, even when I’m not manic) for many reasons. 

I am afraid I’d have my son taken by the state/it would be hard to have my son back in my care once I got out, if I needed my son taken care of someone by the state on the days he would have been with me (his dad and I split the week). His dad got a new job where he works 5 days a week 12 hour shifts. The school goers don’t go back until the 2nd or 3rd of January. I would also feel guilty about not being able to spend time with him even if circumstances are better, but then again I am lashing out and not great to be around anyway. It has gotten to the point where if I am in a bad mood, I can’t see my partner because I end up taking my anger out on them about whatever I happen to be stressed out about. I don’t have any friends. I have one that I’m not sure if we’re still friends because we barely talk anymore and haven’t hung out since spring because I’ve been revolving my life around being around my partner (not my partners fault at all). I do not know who to talk to. The other times I was manic (HYPOmanic, which is a less extreme version), my psychiatrist wanted me to check in to the hospital. I am also in limbo since she is leaving the practice the end of January (thank god), and my new psychiatrist is probably not going to be available right away—you never know. There might be a gap. 

I am medicated, by the way. I’ve gotten over that “maybe I can treat my bipolar naturally” phase. I take trazadone for sleep, so I have been getting enough sleep. Example, I got 10 hours of sleep last night. I take trileptal for the mood. Dose got doubled to 150mg twice a day, just last week. Will take a while for it to have any affect/improve. Antipsychotics work quicker, from what I understand. I wish I could get a shot of haloperidol but I have a son to take care of and can’t be knocked out without him being supervised for however long. 

I feel screwed. 

And even if I could check myself in, without worrying about what’s happening outside of the hospital, I swear there’s always that one shift with all of the mean nurses all at once. I also feel like the hospital can help, in some ways, but it is also stressful being around other people, that you don’t know, that are also not in great states. It amplifies my paranoia because you never know why some of them are there/what they did. 

If there is anything I can do to calm down with the anger, please help. If I have to admit myself, this would be the third time, and it does not get easier. I still get nervous as shit. Once the ambulance people load you up on the stretcher and they raise it up, you know its real and you can’t say “I want to go home, I feel better”. The whole thing is confusing. I voluntarily admitted the two times I went. The first time, they didn’t even tell me I could have been released when I felt better. I felt tricked. The second time, voluntarily admitted as well. Asked about going home after several days and they said I’d have to write a letter and if it got rejected and I tried fighting it, I could be 302’ed, which scared me into not bothering with writing the letter or however I was supposed to request leaving (paper that I signed when I checked in said 72 hour hold—I also don’t understand why it says a certain time frame if you’re not 302’ed).","When you need to be hospitalized, but you have a child and no one to watch them","[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,-0.01577832197649381,-0.10311655764867061,-0.10311655764867061,0,1,0,0,0,No-Implement-5693,-0.015799106143577265,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,22,4

bipolar,"After an episode of hypomania, I fell into a deep depression. I finally saw a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me as bipolar and autistic. I never left my parents' house. I had worn-out clothes, no physical activity, no acquaintances I saw outside. I did nothing all day except get depressed. That was in 2018.

In 5 years I came back to life because of the medication my psychiatrist gave me. I was finally able to build up a circle of friends and started doing physical activities. I moved into an apartment and bought new clothes. I stopped destroying myself trying to build huge projects. Now I can enjoy a sunset, a book, a joke.

The climb out of the pit of depression isn't over yet, but I'm stabilized. I'm much better than I was 5 years ago, even if some weeks are difficult. When people tell me I don't look bipolar, it's great news, it means the meds are working.

bipolar,"Hi everyone- I’m looking for stories of success and recovery. I’m open to advice. 

A manic episode recently had completely changed life as I know it. I’ve been severely depressed about it for over 5 months now and have since been unable to find a semblance of joy again- I used to be quite bubbly and driven, had many hobbies, and many connections. I am now isolated, angry, and unable to do basic tasks like keep my space clean or drink water. It feels too late in life to rebuild, build a life with someone, and have a family like I desire. I’m 29. 

I’ve done embarrassing things that I have shame from and am unable to look forward with any sort of hope. So many things have been destroyed and I find it painful to even put them into words. After being hospitalized, I decided to give life a real go again but find it impossible to connect with anything or anyone anymore. 

I feel a need to pick up and move very far away for a fresh start, hoping distance from the pain will help, however, my family is my only support system and leaving them would be difficult. I also don’t want to just run away from my problems. 

I’ve taken on a very helpless/woe is me attitude. I’m just so tired but I want to fight this and find happiness again. I have a therapist and medication. I just started a new job where I make decent money. All of my basic needs are able to be met so I am grateful for these supports.

bipolar,"Hi all, want to share my experience in case it's useful to others (and it's just my experience, some have had it much worse, or different I know).

**DIAGNOSIS**

* One year ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar Type II.
* Key symptoms were a 15 year history of long bouts of depression (and anxiety, which I received a round of psychologist appointments for each time, roughly every 2 years coinciding with big life events/change), very serious plans to join the 27 club, and hypomanic episodes getting more frequent (cycling between depression and hypomania with no normwl time in between for 6 months+). Also, history of it in my family sealed the deal for the psychiatrist to diagnose me. This was all triggered by a massive change in my life and a loss.
* I was convinced I was coping alright throughout this whole time of acute struggle. I enjoyed hypomania, it was a nice release from the dullness of depression, I got super into hobbies and could deep clean everything, not need sleep, feel crazy energy, but it does get to a point of crisis by the end of a super saiyan week where my decisions got weird and I was a bit out of touch with reality, saying and doing whatever, then a dreaded comedown. Depression was awful of course, but it's not my first rodeo, and had enough strategies in place to wait it out. Note that I didn't really recognise hypomania at the time, I didn't know anything about BDII.
* Why I finally decided to seek help was not because I was cared about myself, but because I was losing my memory (lack of sleep related? I'll never really know) and was worried I would hurt someone else inadvertently. I was often losing focus in a big way while driving, just for 30 seconds going into a dreamlike state not knowing what I was doing or where I was - that's enough to drift into an innocent person coming the other way (and I live in a rural area so people are going 100km/h or 60mph, pretty much instant death if you crash). Worst memory fail was trying to fill out a form and not being able to recall my own name, lucky I had ID on me so I eventually remembered and got through it.

**TREATMENT**

* From a doctor's appointment to a psychiatrist to be available was 3 months.
* Two resources I found helpful in the first few months to learn about it all, were the free workbook from [CCI](https://www.cci.health.wa.gov.au/Resources/Looking-After-Yourself/Bipolar) (a website I was recommended by a psychologist in my depression/anxiety era), and [Bipolar II Disorder Workbook](https://www.newharbinger.com/9781608827664/the-bipolar-ii-disorder-workbook/).
* Started mood tracking so I could accurately tell my psychiatrist what I needed. I started lamotrigine on daily 25mg, slowly increased to a daily 100mg - my mood stabilised on that amount so psychiatrist agreed I could keep on that unless something changed.
* I found the psychiatrist experience great - it was like all my struggles were acknowledged as real (idk, sometimes psychologists seemed to suggest that it was a thinking/attitude problem you could solve and it was frustrating) and he was just matter-of-fact and it was validating.
* Didn't feel the need to go back to a psychologist. Had a bad experience with my last attempt and I have a lot of helpful strategies from my last 5 or whatever. Talking about yourself is exhausting. Wouldn't recommend neglecting this side of treatment though, I am going to try again.

**OUTLOOK**

* I've still had a couple of hypomanic episodes this year, and a few bouts of depression - but they are way less severe and don't last as long as they used to, therefore it's much easier to maintain a normal-ish life. I've got a steady job again, and feeling more stable.
* Memory and focus have basically returned. I feel a bit dulled and slow to understand, only sometimes but it's nothing too noticeable. I write everything down.
* Told my immediate family, and one friend (who also shared another diagnosis with me, so it felt safe to share with her), and that's it. They're chill, don't think they really understand it and I've appeared high-functioning most of my life (mostly because I self-isolate whenever I have an episode, like a werewolf haha). I don't think I'll tell anyone outside of that group.
* Things I'm still struggling with — accepting the diagnosis and reconciling it with my identity. Don't like the idea of taking a pill for the rest of my life. Feel a bit exhausted and hopeless thinking about the future, just experiencing this over and over. I also just don't want to be constantly aware of my mental health, it'd be nice just to not worry for a while.
* This year I'm going to find a good psychologist again, and request DBT instead of CBT (think I've got everything I can out of it). I *know* there's hope for the future, but I need to work out how to *feel* it. I also need to build up a better support network (how, I'm yet to work out), and get some healthy routines going, because you can feel like shit without that, even when you're not technically depressed.
* Things I've found helpful - keeping a daily record (3 memorable/grateful moments, and a mood rating; 1-7, 1 being dangerously depressed, 7 being dangerously manic, 3-5 being a normal range of moods), stream of thought journalling once or twice a week. Keep a simple list of easy things that improve your mood and tick what you managed to do each day.

I turn 19 on January 1st which is in an 40 minutes and I feel like shit.

This year I self sabotaged to the max, I wasn’t the best person, lost friendships because I was too suicidal to be around and a ticking time bomb, they never knew if I was going to die or not and left. (I never made it anyone’s problem, I tried to keep this side of my life from them but they’d hear about my self destructive behavior from others such as my parents that have big mouths and love to speak about my suicide attempts/hospitalization to gain sympathy from others. It cost me my friendships because what I tried to do to myself allegedly hurts them).

I ended a relationship I was happy in because I genuinely thought I was going to end my life. She refused to let me leave her but I knew I couldn’t drag her down my path. I felt guilty about staying with her knowing she could do better than be with someone who wasn’t sure of their future. I eventually left her and it broke her, she hates me now but blames herself for not being able to fix me when that was never her problem to fix in the first place. 

This year I was nothing but a major headache to the people in my life and myself, I’m surprised I made it to this day. 

I don’t want to ruin my life, I want to give this life a chance once again. I started new meds, got back in contact with my therapist that I ghosted and have a psychiatric appointment on Tuesday. I hope 2024 is a year of healing and hopefully not as much self destruction.

Did anyone else have a similar situation before their first manic episode? I've been researching but haven't been able to find what I'm looking for.

Final transformation

Again

Been here 

But it’s changed 

Not scared

Blanket on my eye lids 

I can contort

I’m a a counterfeit 

Rearrange my morals

Replace like a cork

From survive 

To celebrate 

Wanna have that cork explore the ceiling once more

So when I’m manic, this inferno of a Ferris wheel awaits 

Shake all that is a bore

Lie to get by

Been on rails that made me want to die 

Hotel rooms feel like coffins

Don’t want love—need an essence

I’m going to get nauseous 

It gets me claustrophobic 

Can’t hide

My bunker eroded

Live like a spilt drink

Hope nobody notices 

Can’t dwell when you are nervous 

Generate and run

Life splits like atoms 

I am particles

Penetrating throughout the city.",Particles,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Original Art '}, {'a': ':artist:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/0qwk9khze9za1_t5_2qnv4/artist'}]",r/bipolar,-0.6524365320366552,-0.27735798211020646,-0.27735798211020646,0,1,0,1,0,taiyuan41,-0.38663305527416253,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's been 4 months of extreme social anxiety, that extends to my phone. I (24F) can't even read the texts my friends send bc then I'd have to realize how stupid depression makes me act. Everyone knows how I disappeared sometimes. But this time I got diagnosed. I know that's a good thing and I finally have have a chance with meds, but I'm just wallowing in my self isolating bubble coming to terms with everything I've done and trying to forgive myself. 

Since February I really believed I would never be depressed again, and this became a certainty over the following months. But this disease is at its core a masterclass of self sabotage. Icarus is the perfect metaphor.

It's agonizing remembering how I was thriving 6 months ago, on an academic level as well in relationships with friends and SO. The persona who's a social butterfly, out of my hometown, worker-student. My personality, confidence and strength are robbed from me every single time depression comes knocking on the door. My plans and hopes are washed away by the great tsunami of pain and doubt, once again. 

I just needed to vent a little bit. I've been stable but this afternoon just hit me how sad it is to be spending this night alone, because I don't have the energy to pretend everything is okay, until it is. 

I'll probably need to change meds. I'm on 100 sertraline and 50quetiapine (1st time). I need to figure out with my doctor if the quetiapine is dragging me down, bc sertraline/fluoxetine seem to  have worked faster in my previous episodes. I'm from Portugal so sorry about any mistakes.

bipolar,"i could use help getting past the shame and embarrassment of things i did during my first episode, especially from people that have been  stable for a while. 

i got diagnosed with bipolar i in october with medication and drug induced psychosis. my manic episode episode began slowly in the end of august, then i started getting intense delusions in september. 

i started texting a guy i had hooked up with briefly and thought we were getting engaged and that he was in love with me. i thought a girl i hadn’t been close to in years was getting abused by her boyfriend and involved a lot of people from our university. i got angry at some of my closest friends from college over imagined issues. the guy forgave me but the rest have completely ignored me since. 

i went to the hospital overnight three times. the last time was in mid-october, where they put me on risperidone. i haven’t had any manic episodes since but ive been in a deep depression. i’m also in lamictal and wellbutrin but i’m still low. 

i’ve been on medical leave from school since last year for what i thought was deep depression but now it’s more complex. i’m supposed to go back in a month and my family wants me to, but i don’t know if im ready yet. i’m afraid of the brain fog and the idea of socializing with people my age now feels impossible. i just feel so stuck and im struggling to see a way out.",getting past shame and fear,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,AcrobaticWhile6,-0.48776958685523125,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,18,6

But I see it now like just this week I've done a complete 180° as a person. I went from being constantly dead tired to uncontrollably hyper bouncing off the walls energetic. Nonsexual to extremely. 

However now I question if this even is mania because I feel like I wouldnt be able to tell I am completely out of control like I was in my previous so called episodes prediagnosis.

Broken, a word that has a hold unforgiving
The world knows that 
Yet untried in the court of matter is the error of fixing
To fix something means it was broken 
Am I then broken, if I need to be fixed
I never remember breaking 
Only waking to find I am all over the floor
The glue never seals only colors the floor
Seaping to ever crack leaving nothing untouched
I want to clean up the mess but I am the mess
How can I clean with no arms 
How can I fix what is broken if the tool is broke too
Am I then to be broken forever
Let the heavens open and fix my sores
See the angels as they clean the blood soaked floor
See the devils gambling my soul for fools gold
Yet I am not fixed, only scattered to be put back into the system

Hey, I'm really hypomanic right now. Or, I'm in mania. I'm aware and I'm safe, but I'm scared and starting to have minor hallucinations. Whole body is quivering and twitching. Muscles are tensing. Extremely strong mood swings from moment to moment with derealization, muscle weakness and catatonia with the lows. I'm freezing and collapsing. My brain is starting to feel mushy. I know it's getting damaged. Fucking sucks. The worst is knowing that my feelings are hyper-inflated. That they lack legitimacy to an extent.

bipolar,"this is my first year diagnosed (twice) with bp2.  it’s my third diagnosis and i seriously doubt it’ll be my last as i have a feeling the ptsd declaration will be made in the future.

i ran out of my meds last week i think? and i’m physically ill so i have no energy to get more.  i desperately struggled my way through the last semester.  i isolated and i lost friends and spent too much time in bed.  i didn’t do nearly as much cleaning or studying or exploration into hobbies as i’d hoped.

i used to be so motivated in the past.  i had so much zeal for life when i was younger that has just slowly ebbed away, leaving me with all these dreams and aspirations for the future and absolutely no drive to achieve anything.  anhedonia has stripped me of my will.  of my pleasure.  i want to do so many things and i just can’t get myself to even try anymore.  i don’t feel like a human being anymore.  i haven’t for years.  i don’t know why i’m here.

i spend so much time in depression that the occasional hypomania is actually really nice, i feel energy and motivation and drive and it’s great and all until i look at my bank account.  until i realize i’ve been acting chaotically.  but the depression always, always comes back, no matter what i do.  i’m so tired.  i just want to function at a basic level, be able to shower and take care of hygiene regimentally, be able to hand my class work in on time, be able to interact regularly with other people, be able to invest time in the things i enjoy rather than staring at a screen for hours like a zombie.

i went to a psych ward for the first time this year.  it was… a lot.  it was a week long involuntary hold and i felt like i got forcefully kidnapped.  i’m determined never to go back again.  i was there rightfully i guess and have the scars to prove it, they managed to get a court order and all, but involuntary always sucks doesn’t it?  i don’t think i actively want to die anymore at least, but i don’t seem to know how to live either.  i don’t know if i want live yet.  i am simply surviving.  all i have been doing this year and longer is surviving.  

i’m in therapy.  i’m (usually) on meds.  and they do make me feel better, like i’m just barely floating, but i’m always just waiting to be pulled under water again.  it’s a vicious and exhausting battle with my own mind.  i’m so tired of fighting constantly.

bipolar,"   
This is happening to me lately, and I'm not delusional/manic/psychotic.  


I'm my usual anxious self, occasionally paranoid, sometimes depressed.  


But  their behavior is negatively impacting my mental health, in a way where  I can see them feeling like they've proven themselves right about their  preconceptions.  


They're bringing up content from my one and only  psychotic episode around 10 years ago, which was caused by  stress/drugs/lack of sleep/abuse at home. I still sometimes get a bout  of paranoia regarding things/delusions I was in the past worried about,  I'm not delusional anymore about them though and it's kind of a ptsd  type of thing where I might experience fleeting anxiety on it.  


They  communicate about it using subtext. As an example (not a real one  that's happening), say I'm overweight, my dad might start talking about  his overweight colleague and describing characteristics about them that  are similar to mine, while giving me a certain look. I'm fully aware  that this may sound like a delusion of reference, in the past I have had  those, but I have also established during periods of stability that my  dad does communicate this way at times in order to make people feel  insecure. My sibling who is mental stable-ish (narcissist imo) also agrees he does this often.  


When I call them out on their behavior they deny it.  But they Definitely are doing this, which is stressing me and fulfilling  their confirmation bias. I can tell even me noticing and bringing up  what they're doing, in their mind confirms their false narrative.  


It's  frustrating because as I said it stresses me, but I'm simply not at all  worried/delusional about the things they're implying that I am.  


I  am now stressed about their distorted views on me though, and the fact  that I'm pretty sure they're now spreading this narrative to others. And  they have triangulated various family members against me.  


Any  one else experienced this? How do you get people to see that you're  doing okay (at least not anything like as bad as the way they think).  


In  the past this kind of gaslighting has severely impacted my mental  health, and I still struggle sometimes with paranoia particularly during  times of stress. I'm not sure if they know that their approach is  counterproductive, but I don't know how, or if, I should try to  communicate that.  


Sadly my family members are all pretty  dysfunctional and quite abusive and narcissistic at times, so I might be  wasting time trying to get them to be reasonable, but I'm not ready to  move out yet either.  


I also think on some level they want to see  me stressed to make themselves feel ""bigger"", I'm usually treated as the  family scapegoat for context.  


Any tips welcome,

bipolar,"Let me Re-preface, I DO NOT mean using weed as a treatment for bipolar or in place of any prescribed medication or treatment regimen because that is just NOT at all what I'm talking about. I'm also not trying to encourage anyone use it either.

For context, I smoked for a very short while after a friend gave me her old pen and noticed that it really improved a lot of things for me physically (I regularly get bad migraines and have fibromyalgia alongside other pain disorders) and it also helped with my nightmares, fear around sleep, and panic attacks. I've read multiple studies and analyses talking about how cannabis can affect people with bipolar and I've also checked how it could interfere with my medications so I am aware of the risks. I've thought about the pros and cons for myself and feel like it might be worth talking about to my psychiatrist. I'm curious about how I can bring this up with him and about anyone else’s experience have they done that sort of thing, plus, anyone’s experiences when it comes to using cannabis especially if you have problems along with bipolar like other mental illnesses or chronic conditions. (I know it differs from person to person and I don’t intend to use this as evidence on whether I should use it or to prove or disprove any current knowledge on cannabis use and bipolar disorder, it would be completely anecdotal and would not in any way be valid in that regard.

For anyone who uses or is planning on using cannabis, I would suggest that you do a bit of research because there is evidence that it can have an impact on different aspects of bipolar disorder as well as treatment. Also, if you take medications it may be best to talk to a professional like a psychiatrist or pharmacist regarding that because there could be interference.

That being said, there are very limited studies around this specific topic and even then a lot of the research can’t be entirely conclusionary. This isn't to say that you should not consider the research that has been done or not look into it yourself because you definitely should it's just good to look at it knowing all the variables.

(BTW! I reread the rules before I wrote this because I wanted to make sure this didn't break them and I don't think that it does. If I misinterpreted something and this does I apologize.)

Also, don't use this as an opportunity to try and encourage people to not take their medications or to question the validity of actual pharmaceutical treatment, this is nowhere near my intention for this post and I cannot stress enough the importance of actual medical treatment under the supervision of a medical professional.

I'm 36 and feel like I've lost my ability to sleep without some sort of assistance. I spent most of my senior year of high school with between 4-6 hours a night of sleep. At the same time, I used to request close/open shifts at McDonalds. We were out of the store by 11:30pm and I was back by 4:30am.

More recently, I've spent years (3-5) running on 3-4 hours with 18 hour catchup sessions on the weekend. As of today, I can no longer sleep in blocks longer than 3-4 hours without Seroquel. I skipped two doses in the last month, both resulted in 40+ hour awake periods and like these little multi-day manic aftershocks.

bipolar,"This is just me expressing emotion that i havent been able to express before. So I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder by a psychiatrist after suffering for a long time with what doctors (GP's) thought was Major Depression.
Reading up on what people have experienced because of this illness, what people have lost because of it, makes me feel understood in some way I guess? Reading about aggression for the smallest things like loud volume or other stuff that make others think we're just full of shit. Or about how people go into such dark depressive episodes that it feels like the world is closing in.
I feel relieved knowing that there's hope in that I can now start using what is hopefully the right medication,  I've been on antidepressants and antipsychotics but now they've added a mood stabilizer which should kind of balance things out I guess. 
I've struggled, like really struggled with my mental health for a very long time and nobody has ever really understood why my mood would flip on a dime or why I'd be incredibly happy one day, waking my partner up at 4am because I've got these grand ideas that I just have to speak to somebody about and then wanting nothing to do with anybody the next without anything triggering mee
I feel pathetic looking back because the signs were there, I just wasn't a good enough advocate for myself. But I hope things will be different now that I've taken the appropriate steps and hopefully gotten the right diagnosis.
I think the biggest challenge going forward will be home- My partner and some family aren't the most understanding people and even having this diagnosis and them knowing what it's about won't change anything. In their eyes, I'm still selfish when I don't want contact with people for days on end or I'm still overly short-tempered when I have my moments (I am not justifying how I act and react, I know I can be the biggest asshole at times and it eats away at me and I always promise I'll be better but it never works)
I started quatepine twice a day as an introductory dose while will be increased up to 300mg and left at 300mg once a day about 2 days ago and I told my family I don't want visitors (I'm in hospital rn) and I slept the entire day after being given the medication- In my partners eyes, I'm this selfish prick for not talking to him and checking up on him. I'm going to struggle with opening up to my family and to therapists but it's ultimately something I've got to do if I want to become stable I guess.
Does anybody have advice for me? Especially if you were diagnosed as an adult after years of misdiagnoses and family fights.

bipolar,"This is happening to me lately, and I'm not delusional/manic/psychotic.

I'm my usual anxious self, occasionally  paranoid, sometimes depressed.

But their behavior is negatively impacting my mental health, in a way where I can see them feeling like they've proven themselves right about their preconceptions.

They're bringing up content from my one and only psychotic episode around 10 years ago, which was caused by stress/drugs/lack of sleep/abuse at home. I still sometimes get a bout of paranoia regarding things/delusions I was in the past worried about, I'm not delusional anymore about them though and it's kind of a ptsd type of thing where I might experience fleeting anxiety on it.

They communicate about it using subtext. As an example (not a real one that's happening), say I'm overweight, my dad might start talking about his overweight colleague and describing characteristics about them that are similar to mine, while giving me a certain look. I'm fully aware that this may sound like a delusion of reference, in the past I have had those, but I have also established during periods of stability that my dad does communicate this way at times in order to make people feel insecure.

When I call them out on their behavior they deny it. But they Definitely are doing this, which is stressing me and fulfilling their confirmation bias. I can tell even me noticing and bringing up what they're doing, in their mind confirms their false narrative.

It's frustrating because as I said it stresses me, but I'm simply not at all worried/delusional about the things they're implying that I am.

I am now stressed about their distorted views on me though, and the fact that I'm pretty sure they're now spreading this narrative to others. And they have triangulated various family members against me.

Any one else experienced this? How do you get people to see that you're doing okay (at least not anything like as bad as the way they think).

In the past this kind of gaslighting has severely impacted my mental health, and I still struggle sometimes with paranoia particularly during times of stress. I'm not sure if they know that their approach is counterproductive, but I don't know how, or if, I should try to communicate that.

Sadly my family members are all pretty dysfunctional and quite abusive and narcissistic at times, so I might be wasting time trying to get them to be reasonable, but I'm not ready to move out yet either.

I also think on some level they want to see me stressed to make themselves feel ""bigger"", I'm usually treated as the family scapegoat for context.

bipolar,"I dont even know where to begin.

I (30M, Bipolar 1) came from a broken family. My parents (mum, especially) did well financially. She supported all her children needs but not me. Idk why. Maybe because she is ashamed that her son have a mental disorder. So i basically had to build my life from ground up myself. But its hard because i only have high school cert with no real life skills.

Life wasnt that good until i met my wife. She's awesome for accepting me for who i am. (Met her when i was having psychosis mania, but thats a story for another time.) Still broke af but at least i started to feel happy with life.

Long story short, i struggled financially for not being able to stick with a job. Worked min wage jobs, wife works too, helping to keep food on table. We lived in a ghetto but cheap apartment.

And fast forward years later

I finally managed to land a good job that i can finally stick to. (Low stress level and good pay). Before this, i could only work at a job for maximum 3-4 months.

And due to having that job, i managed to get 2 credit cards and due to have been working a stable job. I could apply for all type of loans. And most of it was approved.

So i started to buy cars, get a personal loan, moved to a better house. Life was finally good for a while. 

But when manic finally came after working for almost 2 years, i lost it all. I got fired.

That was the start of my downfall.

To keep on living, i had to max out my 2 credit cards. But that only lasted for few months.

I started to not being able to pay my rent and loans, and fast forward few months, the debt collectors keep fucking with me to get the payments. (Calling everyday, threaten with all kind of threats to get the money back). They are not loan sharks btw. Loan sharks are way worse.

Had to move far far away. To start a new life.

Now i live with my inlaws that hates me because i cant provide for my family. My mum hates me even more. I only have my wife and kid. And my wife are currently pregnant. We just found out.


Ive been thinking of declaring myself bankrupt because i have no capability to pay off all my loans.

Im in deepest depression episode of all my life. Rapid suicidal thoughts.

I feel so guilty towards my wife and kids. She is struggling so much to help me. I keep thinking she is better off without me. But thank god she still love me and understand my illness. I cant imagine life without her.

On the bright side, i got offered by a government agency to go for a skill bootcamp (electronics repair course), FOC, but i have to commit fulltime. I could only work part time during night if i need to. 

She's willing to let me go for the bootcamp (6months), to have a skill that could get me a good stable job again, hence, rebuild our life.

But we will struggle for 6 months.

Everyone else thought this is a stupid idea because a man should support the family, not my wife. And they may be right. Maybe this plan is plain stupid.

I dont know guys. I dont even know what advice to ask for. What do you guys think?

I live with one of my best friends, and I have for six years. She knows me really well. 
This summer when I had what might have been hypomania, she asked me to see a therapist because she said she knew I’d crash again. I didn’t think it was necessary but I did it because she asked me to.

In october, I fell back into this bad state. I was referred to a psychiatrist, who saw me once for 30 minutes and diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder, which I don’t think is right. I was referred to a center that treats psychotic illness in young people, and had my first appointment there - she was really nice and said we’ll start from scratch and figure it out. I’m still in that process.

I know I’ve been down before but this time has lasted longer and I’m fighting so hard to get back, but nothing is working and I just feel like giving up. Maybe this is just who I am now, maybe I’ll never get back to being someone who actually does things.

bipolar,"So I’m diagnosed as BD II, but since my brother was diagnosed as schizoaffective I’m wondering if my first episode of depression was really psychosis. 

I could barely talk, I was convinced I was a demon, I was hallucinating on and off, and I would get so convinced a demon was behind me that I would be unable to turn around or look at reflective surfaces or be in a quiet room, stuff like that. I was not communicating most of this due to not being able to speak much, so my doctors at the time just thought I was depressed.

Most of that has happened semi frequently my whole life aside from the talking thing, just to lesser degrees or not all at once. By the time I was talking again I was so used to it that it didn’t seem worth mentioning. I found ways to deal with it. 

I’d been blaming the demon stuff on OCD, but in light of recently discovering I’ve been hallucinating since I was a kid, I’m wondering if the other stuff is worth bringing up to my doctor.

bipolar,"I was doing my best to research this disorder after I went through an extremely bad manic episode and I’m trying to make sense of what I experienced.

After I came out of my manic phase, I realize that what I may have had was a delusion but in the moment it felt too real for it to be dismissed as a delusion. In the height of my  manic phase, I believed that my music playlist was communicating with me. I know it sounds ridiculous, but when I was thinking a certain thought about something, the playlist started playing a song that was a direct reply to what I was thinking and it made sense. It felt like in the moment it was communicating with me.

The same thing happened when I was reading a book on poetry. I would almost ask it a question and I’d flip to a random page and the book would almost “reply” with a poem that made sense after I read it. It honest to god felt like I was communicating with another entity when I was going through it but afterwards it seems so ridiculous. It genuinely felt so real in the moment and it seemed like more than a coincidence, I would ask it questions and it would answer.

I was wondering if this would be considered a symptom of delusions or a delusional disorder? Has anyone else had similar symptoms when they went through their manic phase? 

Is this also something that can be exacerbated  or brought about by stress?

Holidays were busy. My kids are home. I was really sick a few weeks ago. Lots of stress and chaos. The last week my sleep has noticably been less, staying up to 2-3 in the morning (normally asleep by 11). I woke up this morning at 4:30 after 5 hours sleep, feeling well rested (normally need 8-9 hours sleep). I am more motivated. Hyper fixation on stuff (but also have ADHD). More productive. A bit more hypersexual but not as bad as usual. More social. More engaging. 

I think if I can just get my sleep back under control I can make it all go away. It feels good but it's also stressful. 

I'm not being followed by a psych at the moment. And have been off my meds since May and don't want to go back on them (my family doctor is aware and ok with this). I have been doing intensive therapy and self care, but that fell apart over the holidays. And now I am here. 

I am just reaching out. It's been a while since I posted and I am a wee bit panicked. Deep breathing and self care. I think I may need to go into shut down mode and hide away at home for a bit, minimize stress and outside exposure.

bipolar,"The skin in my arm feels like a squirrel is trying to scratch its way out. My arm unwillingly shakes in response to the demands of the relntless rat. Like it's trying to free itself from a thousand angry flees gnawing at its dirty skin. My hand and forearm is pulsating with consistent sizzling warm electric waves. Ebbing and flowing so gently. My neck likewise. The gums have a special atrocity. Itching with a sensation I can liken unto the warm fuzzy yet unwanted tingle elicited by the act of licking the end of a Double-A battery that only the hard strokes of the tip of my tongue can soothe. 

This sense experience has a queer preference for the lateral left hemisphere of my body, occassionally visiting my lower half out of vain curiosity. My mind is in a state of desperation of trying to maintain sanity and tranquility, suppressing feelings of frustration, anger, vexation by inhaling deep wells of oxygen in a wave-like motion which seem to overwhelm and consume these anguishing emotions like evil monsters made of dry sand on a stormy beach. 

It's scary and crazy how this medication has created within me a monster that was not there before, which awaits beyond the walls built up by dopamine-blockading agents. Hungry to devour my sanity and sense of rest and peace. I now battle two demons in my mind. One which lays asleep when Quero the Hero (what I've just decided to call my Seroquel) fights off the day-to-day bipolar demon. 

At this moment, I feel calm in my brain. My personal causation is strong and I know I can self-manage this augmented reality and antagonising- (train of thought abruptly interrupted). I don't feel manic, though, which is good. I am tired in fact, in my brain, but my mind and limbs are charged by floods of unregulated dopamine as they no longer know how to modulate themselves.

She knows I’ve been hospitalized for mania, though… she also knows and has seen how I get debilitating depression…

Today she pulled me aside to tell me she thinks I am autistic and have ADHD and I need “treatment” for that (which is offensive to neurodivergent individuals imo because autism cannot be cured and doesn’t need to be.. she was suggesting I need to “cure” it). 

She legit went on for an hour about how bipolar is a clear misdiagnosis and I have mild autism and ADHD. Btw I have no symptoms of autism and her argument for adhd and autism is I’m “quirky” and sometimes have a lot of energy. 

She also talks about how bipolar people are crazy, therefore I must not be bipolar. She makes fun of my aunt and calls her crazy because she’s bipolar.

I avoid this topic with her, but she constantly brings it up (either making fun of people with BP or telling me I don’t have it). I’m so sick of her bringing it up and want her to stop.

bipolar,"Hi all, I highly recommend reading, “Bipolar General: My Forever War with Mental Illness” - Gregg F. Martin.

Retired Major General Gregg F. Martin shares his battle with bipolar disorder and his new mission to combat stigma! 

Gregg Martin is a 36-year Army combat veteran, retired 2-star general, and bipolar survivor, thriver, and warrior. In 2003, Martin commanded a combat engineer brigade during the Iraq war, and the intense stress of combat triggered the genetic predisposition for bipolar and sent him into his first manic episode.

 After his deployment, he fell into depression, marking his first up-down cycle. For a decade, these swings of mania and depression continued, going undetected, undiagnosed, and unknown by him or anyone around him. It wasn’t until 2014, during an episode of acute mania, that he was removed from his role as President at the National Defense University and began receiving help. With treatment and support from his family, friends, and an in-patient stay at the VA Hospital, Martin has found a new mission in combatting mental health stigma to save lives.

bipolar,"(Some edits made as requested)

Long post, but detail needed to explain my story.  (52 M) New to this group. Have been Bipolar 2 diagnosed since I was about 18.  I had trauma when my 15 year old brother was killed in an accident on vacation, which I’m sure also contributed to my issues.  Despite this, I’ve been lucky enough to manage to hold down a well paying job, 16 years at my current employer. Was married 19 years, divorced as of 18 months ago, have two wonderful kids and we are all on very good terms. My ex even supports me emotionally and worries about me.

Two things that are major issues for me, becoming worse than ever now. First financial  -  despite earning $250k+, when married we always ended up way over spending. Some of it was also my ex’s fault, but when we divorced we were $100k in debt, just from credit cards. Luckily we had enough equity in our home to clear that. 

Now after buying my own home, 18 months later I’m almost $100k in debt again. Credit cards, $15k property tax bill I didn’t escrow, income tax bill, and embarrassed to admit money spent on girls - strip clubs, sex workers. That’s another story. Some of this was bad financial management, but much I would attribute to mania, spending on stuff like Hi-Fi gear, and the girls to alleviate my loneliness, difficulties with relationships, plus feeling the constant need for sex when manic.

Second, in the last month, I’ve gotten into a sugar baby relationship. Found a girl on one of these sugar websites living locally who is a stunning 26 year old from Ukraine. Absolutely not a bimbo, she’s smart, and works as artist. She sugars to support herself and develop her business and art. Again the morality of the sugar lifestyle is another topic.  I believe there is very much a difference with a long term sugar relationship and a sex worker.

Two thoughts here that concern me. I’m developing feelings for this girl after a month and 6 dates.  She certainly enjoys being with me and finds me attractive - these girls can choose from 100s of guys on these sites. But of course she’s doing it for the money.  I know I’m being ridiculous but I can’t help but convince myself this could become a real relationship and long term.  I have challenges building and keeping romantic relationships - I fall in love quickly and generally scare people away.  The sugar baby thing means she sticks with me despite my faults.

Second huge issue is funding this sugar “addiction” to this girl. We agreed $3k a month for an exclusive relationship - no boyfriends, no other sugar daddies.  Yes sex is involved of course but also genuine date time together. But I’ve already taken out a $17k 401(k) loan to fund 6 months with her, and as I say above currently getting a $100k heloc  of of my home equity to get me get clear of debt AGAIN.  Of course if I’m with her 6 months and more, I’ll be in fully in love with her and nearing being financially ruined.

So a big mess. Just wanted to tell my story and see who can relate. Would welcome constructive advice and comments. Please don’t judge me for stupidity with money or morality of sex workers and sugar babies.   I’m on medication, have a great psychiatrist and new therapist, but haven’t as yet been brave enough to share the full extent of the financial side.

Thanks everyone.

we spent the weekend together. we didn’t get a lot of sleep, and were drinking. lots of sex the first few days, but after a while i had no desire for physical touch. however, i did not know how to voice these feelings in the moment without making the other person feel unwanted. i even initiated sex at one point and it made me nauseous but i kept going.
i could feel my mind turning on them and felt powerless to stop it - everything they said annoyed me, i was distrustful of their motives, and i felt unsafe in my body.

bipolar,"39M, Argentinian living in Argentina

Diagnosed: mid 2019 during 1st and only hospitalization.

First symptoms looking back: Late 2016

Current meds:
Lithium
Lamotrigine 
Wellbutrin XP
Clonazepam
Olanzapine

I’ve been having these 2 not urgent but persistent and life altering symptoms:

1. I can’t get up at the time I want in the morning. It’s as if there’s a force greater than me that doesn’t let me. Please don’t think that I’m just being lazy lol. It might be related to not wanting to confront my current job because I’m able to get up for other activities (therapies, on weekends, etc). Ideally I wake up several hours before my work starts (11am) and am able to go run some errand, run, gym, swim, go to a nice place for breakfast. I have no trouble sleeping and I’m not in a (hypo)manic state. I have no trouble identifying signs for those states and those are not the case.

2. I’m stable and balanced but I seem to have lost that “life-spark” that makes you want to create things, activities or any kind of new things. It’s as I’m existing only to respond to outside triggers (work requests, friend calls, medical suggestions). It’s not terrible but I have a little voice inside saying that I’m wasting my life away. I once believed this was related to Lithium. Tried leaving it for Lamotrigine (during the course of 1 month) and had strong paranoia episodes. So went back to Lithium.

Anyone having similar symptoms or advice?

So I'm diagnosed with Severe Major Depression but my psyc doctor is keeping an eye out for bipolar. Given my past history of being really depressed all the time, but also swings of what we both think is mania. I'm about 2 years out from telling anyone anything. That only happened because I fully lost my shit and no longer saw a way out. Someone stood between my firearms and me... and they called 911.

I take my meds, I communicate with my doctor, I talk to my Significant Other. But everything is still just going down hill.

bipolar,"I always see all these post from people who are so scared of what their future holds after a diagnosis so I figured I’d share some positive. 

I’ve been diagnosed for 6 months. I ended up hospitalized after a failed attempt. I understand I’m extremely lucky but I quickly found the right med combo to keep me stable, adjustments had to be made dosage wise but I’ve accepted there’s a learning curve. 

In those 6 months I was able to get myself back into school, finished the equivalent of my associates and now I’m set to start working towards my bachelors on the 8th. I’ve saved some money and moved into a new apartment. I quit drinking and work out daily. I’m mending a lot of the relationships I really fucked up due to erraticness. My child is THRIVING (probably the best part for me personally). My SI is completely gone. 

I’m learning who I am outside of it, which is the hardest part. We feel and always will feel every thing more intensely but I don’t think it’s a bad thing anymore. The acceptance and clarity comes with time. I’m also humble enough to know it could all come crashing down at any moment so I refuse to waste anymore time.

bipolar,"Long post, but detail needed to explain my story.  (52 M) New to this group. Have been Bipolar 2 diagnosed since I was about 18.  I had trauma when my 15 year old brother was killed in an accident on vacation, which I’m sure also contributed to my issues.  Despite this, I’ve been lucky enough to manage to hold down a well paying job, 16 years at my current employer. Was married 19 years, divorced as of 18 months ago, have two wonderful kids and we are all on very good terms. My ex even supports me emotionally and worries about me.

Two things that are major issues for me, becoming worse than ever now. First financial  -  despite earning $250k+, when married we always ended up way over spending. Some of it was also my ex’s fault, but when we divorced we were $100k in debt, just from credit cards. Luckily we had enough equity in our home to clear that. 

Now after buying my own home, 18 months later I’m almost $100k in debt again. Credit cards, $15k property tax bill I didn’t escrow, income tax bill, and embarrassed to admit money spent on girls - strip clubs, sex workers. That’s another story. Some of this was bad financial management, but much I would attribute to mania, spending on stuff like Hi-Fi gear, and the girls to alleviate my loneliness, difficulties with relationships, plus feeling the constant need for sex when manic.

Second, in the last month, I’ve gotten into a sugar baby relationship. Found a girl on one of these sugar websites living locally who is a stunning 26 year old from Ukraine. Absolutely not a bimbo, she’s smart, and works as artist. She sugars to support herself and develop her business and art. Again the morality of the sugar lifestyle is another topic.  I believe there is very much a difference with a long term sugar relationship and a sex worker.

Two thoughts here that concern me. I’m developing feelings for this girl after a month and 6 dates.  She certainly enjoys being with me and finds me attractive - these girls can choose from 100s of guys on these sites. But of course she’s doing it for the money.  I know I’m being ridiculous but I can’t help but convince myself this could become a real relationship and long term.  I have challenges building and keeping romantic relationships - I fall in love quickly and generally scare people away.  The sugar baby thing means she sticks with me despite my faults.

Second huge issue is funding this sugar “addiction” to this girl. We agreed $3k a month for an exclusive relationship - no boyfriends, no other sugar daddies.  Yes sex is involved of course but also genuine date time together. But I’ve already taken out a $17k 401(k) loan to fund 6 months with her, and as I say above currently getting a $100k heloc  of of my home equity to get me get clear of debt AGAIN.  Of course if I’m with her 6 months and more, I’ll be in fully in love with her and nearing being financially ruined.

So a big mess. Just wanted to tell my story and see who can relate. Would welcome constructive advice and comments. Please don’t judge me for stupidity with money of morality of sex workers and sugar babies.   I’m on medication, have a great psychiatrist and new therapist, but haven’t as yet been brave enough to share the full extent of the financial side.

Thanks everyone.

before i forgot to mention that both my grandma and mom do have bipolar 1, and so do I. ive never been in contact with them as i am adopted, so ive never learned much of them and how they worked with bipolar. all i know is my mom was addicted to opioids, when she gave birth to me. The only reason how i learned that i got it from genetics was when i got in contact with my biological father.

bipolar,"I'm at a total loss for what to do. I see an in network therapist and a psychiatrist who has a private practice (doesnt work with insurance) and my psychiatric appointments are $180 a pop. Usually I only have one appointment every three months, so finding an in network psych has been on the back burner. It's not just like shopping for a toaster on Amazon, ya know? It's pretty difficult. 

So over the last two weeks, I had a psychiatric appointment and we decided to add a new medication to my treatment on top of the one I'm already taking. After a week of taking it and having really intense mood swings, my therapist recommended reporting the symptoms to my psychiatrist. Long story short, I somehow am facing a second psych appointment 3 weeks after the previous one. So that would be $360 in the course of one month just to manage medications, on top of the $100/month I pay for therapy. 

The worst part of this whole situation is how dysfunctional and unprofessional the communication is at my psychiatrist's office. Is this kind of scheduling normal for medication management? It feels like I'm being financially punished for a having a bad reaction to the meds, and I feel disincentivized from reporting the symptoms before my next appointment.

The only option I have is to slowly take myself off of it, but I’ve definitely been dealing with insomnia/disturbed sleep.

It’s been helping for now, and I’ve been using melatonin as a replacement, but I definitely won’t have enough to continue this within the next couple days.

bipolar,"Tl;dr — I believe I’ve been unknowingly experiencing hallucinations my whole life that have been induced by extreme anxiety, grief, and trauma.

I’m going to apologize in advance because this is going to be super long. I (28 F) have had bipolar II ever since I was a kid, but wasn’t formally diagnosed until a few years ago. Both of my parents have BD II and I share the same symptoms and tendencies, even as a young child. From the ages of 6 through 12, I only slept maybe 3-4 hours per night (which I believe may have been a 6-year chronic mania episode — not totally sure). Every night I would see figures in the dark and hear things that obviously weren’t there (like people walking up and down the hallway all night / seeing dark shadows and figures beside my bed). Being a kid, I believed in monsters and ghosts, so I thought those were what were keeping me up at night. I remember being so full of fear and anxiety my whole childhood about hearing and seeing things at night. I obviously grew out of that, but would still hear and see strange things. I kind of ignored it and just chalked it up to my eyes playing tricks, and would  also convince myself that I didn’t actually hear anything. I lived with my grandparents due to the severe consequences of my parents’ bipolar episodes, and when I tried talking to them about it, but they never believed me. Once I turned 17, the sounds and figures went away. However, they briefly appeared again when my mom passed away in a car accident. I saw my mom standing in my kitchen once, and occasionally heard her voice. My mom’s death was extremely traumatic, so I had gotten into some new age stuff at that time to cope, and convinced myself that maybe it was her spirit or something. The sights and sounds of her stopped, and I lost interest in spirituality. 

Fast forward to a week ago — I realized I was dipping into a full blown mixed episode. I’ve been trying to ride it out, but it seemed to be getting worse. I got into a pretty serious argument with my boyfriend New Year’s night, and we are currently on the verge of breaking up. and have been in a panicked state with severe anxiety. I have some trauma from abandonment, so this is causing me an unbearable amount of anxiety, panic, and stress. As you all know, BD makes it difficult to be in a healthy relationship, and a lot of us end up alone because of it. 

Last night I started seeing shadows that were similar to what I saw as a kid. And this morning as I was laying in bed, I saw a man standing in my bedroom. He disappeared after about 10 seconds, which felt like the longest 10 seconds of my life. I got the same feelings of anxiety and fear as I did when I was a kid.

I started reading things online, and realized that my bipolar episode, coupled with my overwhelming anxiety, may be causing hallucinations. I’ve been thinking about my experiences when I was a kid, and I’m starting to think that I’ve been experiencing hallucinations my whole life. I know now that bipolar disorder can cause hallucinations, especially coupled with extreme fear, anxiety, and trauma (this wasn’t something I was aware of until today). I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience? Like hallucinations due to anxiety and or old feelings resurfacing from previous trauma? I’m going to address this with my doctor, but some advice on how to manage would also be great. I’m afraid I’m going to have hallucinations that last for years again. I’m also not going to rule out the possibility of schizophrenia. I’m currently on 150mg of Lamotrigine, so maybe I need to increase my dose.

I do have regular blood tests, although these have been reduced to every 6 months. I’ve been on it for two years.

What I’m concerned about is how my blood results are monitored.

I have found methods to try to calm my mind when I'm hypomanic and a couple ways to try to improve my condition while depressed, but the most important tools in my ""bipolar toolkit"" are those of prevention  - e.g getting a healthy amount of sleep regularly at the same time and putting on the brakes when I'm getting too excited.

If you're having a tough time right now, even just observing the patterns in your mood and behaviour is helpful in the long run. after each episode (or during if you're capable of that) try to think were there any things that triggered it, and was there any behaviour that prolonged it.

bipolar,"Hi everyone! I’m bipolar type 1 and have been getting treated for almost 13 years (I’m 30 now). A lot of those years have been spent in and out of episodes, or trying to manage the beginning symptoms of episodes. Even more of those years have been spent trying different medications/combinations (I’ve tried 9 separate medications and 15+ combos and dosages). 

I went through a lot this last decades, including some hospitalizations with mania, and some over drinking and use of substances, some external traumatic incidents that exacerbated my symptoms, deep deep depressions, losing functioning, losing some relationships and even some jobs and opportunities. But I’ve also come a long way and changed a LOT of my lifestyle so that I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been. That said, I still haven’t been stable. I’ve still had debilitating episodes (like now I am in one of my lowest lows) and I’m still struggling and trying to find the right medication that I can tolerate and that actually works on stabilizing my mood properly. 

I guess what I’m trying to say that in the midst of all of this I do struggle with imagining a relatively normal and stable life in the future. I’ve read things that scare me (eg. That bipolar is a progressive disease). I’ve “achieved” a lot in my life (education, career). But I’ve had to interrupt the “normal” progression of my life and stop everything and revert back to relying on family to help me with the day to day too many times… I find it increasingly harder to look into the future and imagine an independent and stable and dignified life…

I’d love to hear from anyone who has reached a degree of “stability” whatever that may look like… to hear from people out there who have done it too and found a way to make it work… I guess I am still holding on to some HOPE :-)",Is anyone out here living a (relatively) “normal” or stable life?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.21034204962500036,-0.21034204962500036,0,1,0,0,0,zedbluegreen,-0.2854965236930938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,20,2

bipolar,"TW: abuse, violence, suicide, self-harm

TL;DR: very very angry rage, any same-stories and fix ups?


Man, I need to vent and also portray how bad this can change who you are. Dudes, eventhrough I had a traumatic childhood and didn't learn to regulate, I did it on my own because I was so effin badass. (also because it was needed for me to survive ofc) Also, I was in therapy for years. Basically, I always try to process my and anyone else's emotions, I always mediate, I am the flower power let's find common ground with love in every dispute, I am also ferm and assertive but proud to say I am so very rarely passive agressive/agressive. People around would confirm I'm calm and ready to act if anything and I condone violence in any way shape or form.

I am F25 and have been diagnosed with MDD and GAD during the very young adulthood (should have been since childhood but whatever). Oh well 2 months ago I have been diagnosed bipolar actually and cptsd/adhd maybe, still in evaluation Idk. 

I always have been a crier. I cry when there is a overwhelming feeling. And oh boy during depression I cry my soul my heart my body out until possibly I enter deplition. Indeed I have experienced until now irritability to be increased especially when the depression was extremly severe but I always pointed it to depression symptom. Here irritability meant FcK I can't concentrate I am so angry, fck I can't read, fck there is to much noise here arghhhh, fck I cannot anymore cope with my emotions so easily I get internally angry. That's the thing. Internally. I did process it into sadness (angry is s secondary emotion and it's always about smth else, most of the time sadness to agony) and I cried as I was saying. Also I'm female and it is more socially acceptable Ig, plus in my environment I could never afford to manifest angryness cause it was too risky for everyone. And still is. 

I attempted suicide one time, right before I got any diagnosis, and I got so effin scared afterwards. Why? Because I couldn't rationally believe I would do such a thing! I felt so invalidated to the point I actually made myself believe I did not attempt it, just because I had never heard at that point of smth similar, only people planning their suicides or at least wanting to die badly. I mean yes, I did had plans at some point, and still want to die (currently in a severe mixed ep) but still I have enough control to understand that it's only my mind playing tricks on me or so I like to call it. Obvsly I was always psych educated. Now I know it's the manic features of a mixed episode that make me 'desperate to die' so to say, impulsive enough to not think through. As you can see it also was hard for me to see because all my life I thought of me as the most non-impulsive person ever lol. Plus, I am a effin psychologist and it was I swear to god impossible for me to see more than depression and maybe some postraumatic stress for myself always. No matter how much you know it is so terribly hard to see hypomania or mania for what it is. Especially when it always comes so masked and interwind for me. I am lucky enough I came out truthfully to my NEW psychistrist to things I have done (because just a tiny bit I was starting to suspect smth more is up but wouldn't accept it/couldn't point my finger on it). If I didn't I probably be hospitalized rn or dead, or anything but still not diagnosed bipolar. 

Anyways, I always knew I had some unexpressed anger and I should rejoin sports. But I also am coming out of severe burn out and never got the time or energy for that. I did many times feel like I just wanna effin scream in the woods or legit anywhere if possible. What I'm saying is that I did feel the rage but I always managed to push it through. 

But man 2 months ago I broke a window at my house with my palm because of rage. I swear I couldn't think straight. I ONLY saw black before my eyes. That's when I knew shit hit the fan. Also I was 5 days sleepless at that point because every second of night my mind was racing how I should end it. That's when I was lucky and rational enough to call an emergency app with a new doc as I was saying, he gave me smth so I don't need to go to the ER but it is sooooooooooooooooooooooo hard. 

I cannot believe the rage I can feel. I am annoyed by literally anything ever. My boyfriend chewing gets me hyperventilating in a separate room so I do not scream at him. I walk the streets and I literally think omg I wanna punch somebody I wanna just punch all these parked cars. Now I realize my teen self-harm was out of impulsive rage too, because I still feel so badly I wanna do it. I try everything, the ribber bands, the cold/hot showers, breathing, meditation (hahhahahaah) etc. I swear I can't put into words this rage. I knew about it from books and cases especially I know it's associated with time in jail especially for males with bipolar but I never thought this was possible!!!!! I still cry my ass out but I also am SO ANGRY!!!! :)

CW for brief mention of suicide &amp; hospitalization

I semi-recently got out of an abusive relationship that led me to be hospitalized for a suicide attempt. In the hospital, they diagnosed me with bipolar II and they said it was possibly the subtype rapid cycling type w/ mixed state. I've had depression my whole life, and looking back on my life it's possible I had episodes of hypomania and irritation as well, but those also could have just been teenage mood swings. I also have some risk factors for bipolar: family members with it and reactions to certain medications consistent with bipolar OR a family history of bipolar. however, I can't pinpoint a hypomanic or mixed episode that lasted the amount actually required for a bipolar II diagnosis (4 or more days). I'm now on a couple medications, and for the most part haven't had symptoms aside from post-traumatic ones and some of the normal chronic depressive thoughts. I did have symptoms (but not enough hypomanic to meet the threshold) after the relationship while I was getting my dosages upped, but I was also experiencing a lot of post-traumatic symptoms. before my relationship there wasn't enough dysfunction in my life from any potential bipolar symptoms to affect my life. all this to ask: is it possible the stress from abuse caused the mania and mixed states that led me to be diagnosed?

bipolar,"After a friend cut me out of her life this past week, I have been doing exceptionally not well. Our last talk/fight basically ended with me falling apart as she broke down how much of a burden I was and just stressed her out, then me pressuring her to block me online so I couldn't reach out again and ranting about how much she never liked, cared about or wanted me. I felt some ideations again and cried when she told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore because it's too stressful. She blocked me.

This person calls me only a friend, but our relationship was always shifting and ambiguous. Our interaction was never fully platonic, often turned sexual, she was basically living here for months, texting all day every day, almost all social activities were together, she'd call me her partner for awhile, then we'd have a fight and she'd claim we were never together, or that I was never a contender for her partner, on and on. She has since pushed this idea that I was only ever some sort of fix-it project and nothing else, leading me to question the reality of things between us. She is herself autistic.

I thought I was making a lot of progress and seeing improvement on 100mg of Lamotrigine. Most of her behavior stopped triggering me at all. After some work stuff went sour and they revoked my ability to work from home, my boss said I didn't conceptually understand the job, then she and I had a fight a couple days later, where she came at me about how I confuse her so much that spending time with me makes her want to go cry in the car. I fell apart.

Since then, I met with my therapist on Weds to talk that over, then my PMHNP yesterday. We're increasing my dosage to 200mg and adding 150mg of Wellbutrin. It's been suggested I take a leave of absence from work and I finally submitted a request yesterday afternoon.

Has anyone done this and were there any issues ensuring you had enough money to survive during that time? I've asked for 3 weeks but am worried it's not enough or that I could lose my ability to live independently, and the stress and sadness and loss I'm trying to grapple with right now is feeling really overwhelming.

I wanted to know some other people’s experience with exercise and sleep. 

Exercise for me is one of the absolute key tools in maintaining my mental health, along with general healthy routine and trying to keep on top of healthy habits. I am super fortunate I can afford to exercise in a private gym, in small group sessions with a trainer who is adaptable and understanding. 

One thing I have always struggled with though is the impact that exercising, particularly HIIT or 1RM days, has on my sleep. I exercise in the afternoon so it’s never too close to bed time, and I try to do a lot of mindfulness and breath work in the evening to bring myself back down to earth a bit. Sometimes I can get to sleep ok but I find myself waking up a lot in the night and struggling to stay asleep. It seems to regularly make sleep a lot harder all round. 

I suppose I’m just wondering if anyone else has a similar issue and whether they’ve found anything else that really helps?

No peace in my skull,

Only a broken crown.

What blessing is this?

That may lead me to salvation or suicide,

That has wrought me into a man steeped in solitude,

Sleepless nights,

Soliloquies screamed alone in a padded cell.

I writhe in pain on my lonely throne of thorns,

I rule nothing, not even myself,

I am ruled by this broken crown.

Cloying madness, sick pride and self-loathing,

Cast down from above the clouds to rock bottom and then hurled back again,

My broken crown shrieks between my ears,

Do other people know silence?

I stand above them, yet so far below,

Peace is a fantasy.

Never for me.

My war is inside my head, 

It follows me everywhere,

Wrestling hopelessly with this broken crown.

We build my dreams brick by brick together,

My broken crown and I.

bipolar,"It’s so hard to explain because my brain feels so weird and overwhelmed, but I don’t know what steps to take from here because I don’t know if my thoughts are realistic/logical, or even make sense because I’m so fucking confused about what’s happening. I am feeling many new symptoms of bipolar disorder I’ve never felt before, and they correlate with being a psychotic episode, which made me want to make sure I won’t fuck up my life if I am. My fear of getting worse is making me become even more distressed, and that makes me even more scared of getting worse, and the cycle repeats and I am only making myself feel more out of control!! how do I stop this quickly, having this many thoughts at once feels like it’s literally eating me alive. 

This is my first time ever experiencing symptoms that aren’t a depressive episode. Since these symptoms started (I can’t pinpoint exactly when, I believe they appeared a little over a week ago), it’s incredibly hard to even focus on a single thought or goal to calm down. I feel like I am constantly sidetracked. I’m considering voluntarily admitting myself to the psych ward first thing when I wake up (if I can even manage to sleep, this is my billionth time trying over the course of staying up 100+ hours) and I’m so confused and I really just wanted someone who understands, even to a small degree, to help me navigate through this because I’m afraid if I don’t take advantage of having logical thoughts right now, I’ll get worse and stop being able to logically think all together. 

I talk to my psychiatrist tomorrow and I don’t even know how to begin to bring all of this up, as in the past, Ive never told her my true feelings and situations (for depressive episodes) and now I want to let her know everything so I can stop feeling like this, but conveying anything is very hard.

I am high functioning BP1 and have been lucky enough to have the support system (and wealthy, loving parents) to develop a successful corporate career that carries a lot of responsibility despite being bipolar. If I do not do my job well nobody will die, but I could significantly impact the performance of the entire organization that most people have heard of.  I have masked my entire life.  Absolutely no one associated with my career in anyway knows about my illness.

My doctor changed my medications in October and I’m sitting in my bed at 2AM realizing how utterly destabilizing that change was and how sick I really am right now.  Throughout my life my secret has been routine, routine, routine. All I desperately want to do is take a month and focus on nothing but changing my meds, managing side effects/withdrawal, extra therapy sessions, and relearning my routine.

I’m considering going out on paid leave (which I know is a blessing most do not have), but I know colleagues will ask why I was out even if HR cannot.

Why did you decided to stay single? (I’m actually curious)

For me it’s not that i want to be single and i would want to be in a relationship more than anything and not that it would help me but so i don’t feel like fighting alone as spiritual support is extremely important to me. Im above average and to find a soulmate wouldn’t take a long time i believe but i wouldn’t want ti be in a relationship as sometimes i get very toxic not intentionally but someone who doesn’t know me would understand that. And i wouldn’t want to hurt someone i truly love with my own bullshit as it can get very difficult to handle a toxic relationship. In general im sweet, caring, and kind but this fkn illness makes me be a demon sometimes and so i feel like dying alone is the best option.

bipolar,"Am I the only one who prefers to think of themselves as having ""manic depressive illness"" rather than ""bipolar disorder""?

""Bipolar"" sounds too clinical and the term ""disorder"" I think carries connotations  that extend beyond mere illness which is what we live with. And and anti-stigma gains that distancing the name from terms like ""maniac"" have I think been totally eroded by now.

""Manic-Depressive Illness"" is the title given to one of \*the\* most established textbooks on the subject, and the authors defend their use of the older terminology, linking manic depressive illness to dementia praecox (now schizophrenia) as Kraepelin did as one of the two causes of psychosis. The authors make the point that it's the recurrence of manic or depressive mood states that is the defining feature of the groups of disorders, not the bipolarity itself. And in their eyes ""manic depressive illness"" covers bipolar I + II as well as recurrent major depression.  


It's an expensive book, but ""Manic Depressive Illness: bipolar disorders and recurrent depression"" is an excellent volume if you want to understand the illness we have in more depth.

I was put on 25mg of Zoloft for 3 months and had enough awareness during whatever mania I had that I needed help. Anyways, I have my first appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow. It’s technically for “medication management” because I told my therapist how I don’t think anti depressants are right for me (quit cold turkey recently- bad idea lol) so she referred me to a psychiatrist she works with in the office I go to. 
Basically I was talking to my friend who has more experience with psychiatry and they told me there’s a good chance I can get diagnosed tomorrow. I’m not in denial that I most likely have bipolar (or any mood disorder tbh) but I think I’m so scared because that means it’s real and I can’t brush it off as a “phase” (bad habit I have). 

I honestly just want to know if anyone’s gone through something similar? And how it got better for them? I know this is also a conversation for my therapist but hearing others perspectives validates mine. Everyone around me who I’ve expressed this to has told me how the diagnosis wont change anything, is just a label, is there to help me, etc. But it’s hard for me to take their advice when we live 2 very different worlds. This has all happened in the last 3/4 months, so big changes in not a lot of time :/.

my moods have been so unhinged lately despite appearing normal from the outside, i have started 3 bullet journals, a tarot tracker, learning 2 languages, and go to the gym for 1+ hr everyday (more than usual). yet despite all these “manic” behaviors, i feel like garbage and have no motivation to actually complete any regular tasks in my day to day life. i feel so utterly alone with how i feel, people only understand depression.

my psychiatrist prescribed me wellbutrin and i started it today to help with my motivation problems. i am an anxious mess wondering if the side effects will send me over the edge because of how weird and dysphoric i have felt. i have a history of akathisia from abilify.

I feel older, my body's older, its not in the same shape as it used to be and I'm deteriorating.  Some people have it much worse than me, and I don't know how they get through the day.  I feel I am spoiled, which is why I'm depressed about crap that genuinely physically unhealthy people deal with every day but seem to just brush it off.    


Anyways, time goes by so slowly throughout the day.  It was a few months ago that I loved my job, was kicking all sorts of ass with it.  It was all due to my mania I had over the summer.  Now its over and the opposite is kicked in and I can't stand my job anymore.  Its changed, its my perception, and its my disorder.  I can't stand doing much anything anymore.  Its all so trite and meaningless it seems.  The whole everything, work every day to pay bills that will allow me to get to work every day and take care of my family.  Yes I know I need to keep going for them, but then again I feel I am a fraud.  Do I feel anything anymore?  I don't think I've been a good dad recently, a good anything recently.  I'm filled with suffering, suffering through each second with death or disappearing from everything would be so much better than enduring this constant distaste for life.    


I try to play guitar and thats fine but its also work, hard work.  I'm lacking motiviation.  I still do my job.  I just want to lay in bed and look at nothing until a fall asleep and temporarily seem to stop existing.  I don't enjoy anything the way I used to and its taking its toll on me.  I've had so many interests in my life, so many promises, so much potential, so much enthusiasm, and now its gone.  Just like you guys I struggle every day right now.  I want to go up to my coworkers and ask them what they fuck gets them through the day to get through this bullshit society day in and day out, but it won't matter.  They play their video games, they have their family, they have their forms of self improvement.  I have mine, but it doesn't even matter, what for?   Perhaps I'm in a midlife existential crisis.  I don't want to get older.  Don't have much of a choice.  I Feel trapped. Wondering how long this episode will last?  Can't shake this mood I'm in and the mood I'm in is backed up by real logical existential philosophy too that goes through my head regularly now.  Sure, I'm put on a good show, but nobody really gets what's going on inside my head.  If they did, they wouldn't like it either.

bipolar,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with bipolar II in June 2023. Took about 15 years to get an accurate diagnosis. I'm still learning how to handle the highs and lows. I had a good 3 months of stable mood but recently had a hypomanic episode and now I'm in a low. It's not a severe low, but I can't seem to get myself to do anything at work. The last 3 months I've been working great and feeling good, so it's a huge bummer to be back to doing nothing. 

My question is, how do you all deal with your symptoms at work? Do you push through the days until you feel better, or do you take sick time? I'm at a point where I'm not accomplishing anything at work, but I feel guilty taking time off. At the same time, I feel guilty sitting here not doing much.

bipolar,"So, the thing is, I have been getting mental health support with psychologists and psychiatrists for more than 3 years. But it seems no one really gets what's going on. I would really appreciatte if you could read and tell me if you either feel like this or if you have an idea of what it might be.

I spent the past 3 years under investigation because everyone thought I might be bipolar. However, I never had a manic or hypomanic crises that resulted in any 'loss"", such as I never cheated on anyone, never spent an enourmous amount of money, etc. So they could never say for sure that this was my problem. 

However, what really happens to me is that I cannot stand my life as it is, without any changes, for longer than 6 months. I start to feel depressed when I see nothing is new and everyday starts to feel like shit (sounds like a regular depressive episode so far). It makes me feel so awful and suffocated that I even consider dropping everything and starting a new life again at some other place, some other job, some new people. However, it's not financially viable for me. And the longer I stay in this situation the worst the depression gets.

But the thing is that this always happens and If I cannot trigger a major change in my life within this period, I will most probably spoil everything like, get fired, end a relationship,etc. Just because I think this is not interesting anymore, and convince myself that the life I really want is somewhere else. 

I want to point that the most important thing is that the feeling I have is not just a normal ""boredom"" feeling, I feel actually suffocated, like as if I am drowning emotionally, and that's why I start to become kinda impulsive and want to run away to start a new life or something like that - which I did some times and that made me really happy for maximum 6 months (sounds like a maniac episode), and then the cycle starts again.

It doesn't sound like a real problem by I can assure that I feel so bad that I thought of suiciding so many times when in this situation. I just want to get rid of this.

Was telling my mother how I have been washing up dishes almost every single day with this system. She laughed about it. And laughed at me for what felt like so long. I stopped talking and just listened to her laugh until she was done. 

I get that it’s unconventional to be so minimalist but it works for me and it’s not like I am about to have a dinner party. 

She doesn’t seem to understand that my mental illness is an illness. To the point of me being disabled.

***this post might be all over the place because of how my brain runs lol***
I’ve recently started to spiral into a manic episode due to my stressful job. Few important notes, I’m not medicated for my bipolar, only for my adhd and my stressful job is serving at a very very high volume sports venue/restaurant.
Alright so, I was diagnosed bipolar while I was a teenager- I was probably 16 yrs old. I’m now 28. It does run in the family. I have in the past been prescribed meds but at the time didn’t like how they made me feel or they just didn’t seem to work. I’ve been on vyvanse for my adhd for about 5 years now and honestly I think it helps a lot with my impulse control when it comes to decision making and keeping me goal oriented, which does wonders for me bc I need structure, as do most of us who struggle with bipolar. Does anyone have any helpful tips or tricks on how to manage their emotions naturally during a manic episode? I’ve kind of just been raw dogging this illness (by choice) but am losing my grip/footing on how to keep the drastic emotions in check at times. I as a person can pick up on things that trigger my anxiety &amp; mania and know when an episode is coming on and I know rationally that my thinking and emotions are distorted, but I just wanna hear other ways people combat their ups and downs on their own.

And yes I know therapy and medication will do me wonders, I’m getting there..I get anxiety when it comes to sitting down and selecting the right therapist and then having to find time in my chaotic and constantly changing work schedule. And maybe I’m dragging my feet and making excuses bc it’s easier than leaving my comfort zone and taking the leap or getting help.

Find a business/page that u wanna do and ask how they build theirs

bipolar,"may contain trigger warnings like religious traumas,,, ig

I'm Southeast Asian, and a lot of SEA parents have ample to no knowledge about dealing with mental health at all. My mom is one of those people who would believe in voodoo and also be a roman catholic at the same time. She's also old enough to be fooled by those ""cure all"" medicines and ointments, and I'm the very opposite of her (considering that she's in her 60s and I'm in my early 20s), whereas I would hyper-fixate on researching about important stuff (to me, at least). 

Long story short, I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder I, after missing my long term quiz, and ultimately found a doctor to give me a medical certificate, and prescriptions. She's not very familiar with the term and she had been viewing me as someone who was rude and moody, not until my diagnosis. 

It was very endearing that she was worrying about me at first. I got to tell her that it had been really long since I was feeling this way (u know,,, depresso and mania) and it wasn't just a one time thing. I was suffering silently ever since highschool and I'm aware of that (I'm in college now). And I was scared to let her know about this because I KNOW she won't take it very well and I KNOW that she's going to try various unresearched thing that claims to ""cure"" people of their said illness. The first few days, she had been following exactly what my doctor told us. NOT UNTIL she contacted her **Dentist** (in bold to emphasize the ridiculousness of the situation) who she claims to know more than what their doctorate degree indicates. She basically booked an appointment with that dentist for me. 

The Dentist made this ""Healing"" Therapy with me (which costs just as much as a real therapy) . Upon seeing their office and clinic, it was clear that they're also very religious given the amount of Jesus-es I've seen. Don't get me wrong, I'd rather let my mom take me to a church and ask the priest to exorcise the hell out of my depression than this weird dentist thing, disinforming my mom about mental health and medications - which, given my luck, didn't happen. 

My mom now believes that everything that my Psych doctor told me is a scheme, intentionally making their patients worse so they could come back to them. I think it's ridiculous that she finds that healing therapy stuff more helpful than a doctor with years of expertise with this stuff, ALL because this weirdass dentist discredited psychiatrists. (TW: &gt;!They basically claimed that my anti-psychotics would make me depend on it and make me feel a lot worse. She then referred to hollywood artists committing s-word because of ""good ol western medicine""!&lt;)

My mom, in turn, made me stop taking my meds (anti-psychotics) and this had made me go back to not sleeping on time with racing thoughts as usual. She's planning to book another appointment with this mojo dentist. This has been making my mental health spiral down again seeing that we're also struggling with money, yet she's choosing to make me go to this clown. She's eager to make me go because she apparently was promised that my mood disorder would go away in a few sessions. 

I'd rather let her take me to go seek Jesus in my life with devotees praying for me, than seek a silent therapy where the dentist would just put her hands on me and make me close my eyes. It's the same thing but free (without any taxes as well).

I apologize for the long post. I love my mom, but this is just ridiculous.

bipolar,"Hi, 

Sorry for the strange title I couldn't really describe what I'm talking about in such a short title.

I am autistic and have bipolar 2. I am currently an inpatient because I reached my limit and broke. 

Today in group therapy we were talking about critical internal monologues, you know your own voice that just hounds you and smashes you with negative self talk, ""you're dumb/fat/worthless/useless"", ""you should just do it, noone will miss you"" etc. 

In this group I felt comfortable and confident to speak up about my experience. And I asked if everyone also heard the other voices as well - those of loved ones, partners, exes, friends, bullies, etc, where you here some of the critical and shit things they've said ""you're not good enough"", ""noone could love you"", ""you're fucking crazy"", ""you're worthless and won't amount to anything"", ""you deserve to be alone"". And if everyone visualises these interactions at the same time.

I found out, that's a resounding ""no"", that this was not normal. Which was qualified further that it is especially not normal to ""see"" the interactions, or feel the sensations of touch or bodily senses of a tug at heart, dropping subject etc, even smell and taste.

I clarified that I don't hear or see these things as hallucinations but in my ""minds eye"" so to speak.

Can anyone relate, has anyone experienced this?

bipolar,"I've currently been on Caplyta 42 mg for 3 months and Ativan 0.5 mg PRN for 2 weeks. I've been doing really well with my motivation coming back, but only with my preferred tasks, like my hobby writing, reading, watching my favorite shows, etc. I've also been able to continue to go to work throughout my depressive cycles, so no changes there, except that maybe it feels easier and I don't feel quite as burnt out about it. 

Yesterday, I had another appointment with my psychiatrist to see how the Ativan was helping with my sleep, and it was going well, so I told her that, but then she asked me if I felt that it was working too well. I get that she has to ask, but I felt that the answer was already implied because I had already told her that I only used it 4-5 nights, only on nights that I absolutely had to sleep because I had work, and not even every night I had work because some nights I already felt tired and ready to crash so I didn't feel as though I needed it. 

Then we started talking about my ADLs. I'd been working on them for months with my therapist with no real progress, so I wanted to bring it up with my psychiatrist for her opinion, especially since she brought up adding an antidepressant last time but then decided against it. My psychiatrist is a resident, so she left to go talk to the attending, and when they came back, they talked to me about adding either Strattera or Effexor and launched into this explanation about how being able to do preferred tasks but struggling with nonpreferred tasks could be indicative of ADHD. My psychiatrist wouldn't tell me her thoughts until I told her mine first, and I told her I was leaning more toward Strattera, but then I feel like I might have over-explained and gave too many reasons why??

I also have a background as a pharmacy technician that they know about, so I don't know if that makes a difference. 

I also specifically used the words ""non-preferred tasks"" when I talked about my issues with my ADLs before they themselves did in regards to ADHD, but I was a TSS before who worked with kids with autism with that being common wording in treatment plans, so it's just part of my vocabulary now.

But because of all of this combined, and the fact that my psychiatrist smiled to herself when I said I was thinking Strattera, I'm worried that they think I'm drug-seeking or something now. My psychiatrist even said something about a low-dose of Adderall before going to talk to the attending and asked me about changing around the frequency of how often I'd need the Ativan. I feel like I'm being tested and I don't like it. I'm feeling pretty anxious, like I'm walking a tightrope with my own psych team.

Has anyone else ever run into this? Were you being tested to see if you were drug-seeking or does it just always feel this way when it comes to these types of drugs? I also currently work in a hospital, so I hear the term ""drug-seeking"" pretty often, so that could just be coloring my perception and making me a little paranoid, right? Idk what to think.

bipolar,"MY QUESTIONS: **Does Mania Present The Same For Everyone?** and **Can Other Conditions Morph The Way Ones Bipolar Presents?**

I recently got assessed for Bipolar Disorder, and received a diagnosis for Bipolar 2. 

During my assessment the psychiatrist mentioned something that struck me, she described mania as ‘running around naked in the street’ (as an example). 

For context, I’ve also got severe complex trauma (CPTSD) &amp; OCD, and have been in a constant state of some sort of depersonalisation since I was little (and it got a lot worse in 2023). I’m anxiety ridden and barely leave my house, and I don’t know how to talk to people. The psychiatrist said I matched the criteria for agoraphobia, but attributed it to my CPTSD.

Reflecting on how my mania/hypomania manifests, I feel like my symptoms aren’t always so stereotypical (in the way my psychiatrist described it). For example, I know I’m manic when I start spending all my savings on hair products and skin care in one sitting, when the voices and images in my head become more chaotic and almost hallucinatory, AND OTHER MORE SEVERE ACTIVITIES THAT I DON’T FEEL LIKE SHARING PUBLICLY LOL. 

I’m very organised, and non-impulsive to my core (I spend weeks doing research on an item, regardless of worth, before I buy it etc), but this goes out the window (to a point obviously) when I’m manic/hypomanic.

I’m a very self-aware and extremely sensitive person due to my complex trauma (I’ve also been told by a psychotherapist to get assessed for autism), so I tend to completely isolate from everyone when I’m having any episode (in relation to my bipolar).",DOES MANIA PRESENT THE SAME FOR EVERYONE?,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.29076116860724766,-0.29076116860724766,0,1,1,0,0,Maybe_A_Human7,-0.3192087008867834,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,9,3
bipolar,"Hi all!

So in the past several months, almost all of my very serious symptoms have disappeared- symptoms that have been present since I was a child. But they've also come with me sleeping 12+ hrs a day, falling asleep at work or while doing things, and having extreme disassociave panic episodes. Nightly delusions I've been having since I could remember? Gone, mostly. I think I've had maybe one unnerved episode, and one proper psychotic symptoms episode that went away within the hour. Mania? Vanished. Major depressive episodes? I've had a single one that wasn't directly triggered by anything.

I have an appointment coming up to request a brain scan, just to make sure nothing is seriously wrong, since my symptoms have been pretty standard since 14, and worsening since 19 (I'm 24 now). I know I shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth, but I figured it's better to be sure. 

That being said, I'm also losing my state insurance next month. I don't know that I'll be able to get the scan done at all. So wish me luck, if you can. If you have any advice (mainly about insurance, or how to advocate for myself at my upcoming apt with this disability in mind- I am not seeking medical advice!) or want to share similar anectodal experiences, I welcome those as well.

bipolar,"When do you know you need to go to the hospital?

Hi there. I’ve been diagnosed since 2017. I had to make some med adjustments last summer and fall due to the med I was on causing tardive dyskinesia. I tried a med that came out in 2019 and it did not work at all. I regressed to having active (bad thing) ideation, mood dysregulation and severe depression. I have been having periods of one night every couple of weeks that I haven’t been able to sleep since that med change. It culminated Christmas weekend with me being up for three days. Currently I have been awake since I woke up Monday morning. Christmas week we discontinued my mood stabilizer (after doubling the dose) and raised the med I’ve been on since 2017 from 1200mg to 1500mg. The first three days after raising the dose I vomited within twenty minutes of taking my medications so I effectively didn’t take my medications for three days. The plan was to continue on the increased dose until my appointment on the 18th and then assess for the need of a replacement mood stabilizer. Obviously, I am calling my clinician first thing in the morning. I just wondered if some of you might share your own lived experiences with when you have made (or would make) the decision to go to the hospital for inpatient med stabilization. 

This is obviously effecting my daily life at home and at work. I just started my job in December and I don’t feel good about med trials to find the right medication. I can see the benefit of an inpatient stay but I also know in the lens of my mental illness I can hyper fixate on an idea whether it is a good one or not.

bipolar,"basically been dealing with bipolar for about 13 years of my life. I'm 25f. 

when I was a teen had many episodes. frequent suicide attempts, self harm, and overdosing. I was in and out of the psychward from 11-17. they tried to push medications into me but I always refused. 

I'm 25 now and I'm realizing alot of things I don't like about myself. 1 being that I depend on alcohol to numb my anxiety. 

I've noticed I've become very sensitive to loud noises, places, screaming. I get extreme anxiety when I'm around it. so even a little trigger like hearing someone scream makes me want to drink. 

I have a number of mental health problems. 
anxiety 
bipolar
ptsd from abuse  
I disassociate 

and the only thing that makes me feel somewhat normal is alcohol. 

f*ck drugs, fuck psychedelics, alcohol is the only thing that makes me feel numb and makes me avoid these feelings I get at night. 

some days I don't even want to be in my own skin. I feel disgusted. the 6 year old girl surfaces and all that sexual abuse comes to surface and I hate myself. I look at myself and feel disgusted. 

I often wonder why my partner is even with me. he knows my issues and still decides to stick around. he says I have such a good heart but there are days where I question myself. and my intentions.

bipolar,"So I’ve been diagnosed bipolar for 14 years, although I’m pretty sure there was about 10 before that. Just over the years I’ve started having stronger delusions. My first strong one was that I was immortal. Right now it’s that I’m part of a simulation and my forgetfulness is when something is reset. They’ve always manifested while I was manic, but this time I’m in a down spiral. The life is a simulation one happens the most commonly. One of my tricks with that is to chat with a friend of mine who is completely unpredictable. Her unpredictability shows me that at least she is not a simulation, which helps me to dig my way out. Simulations are predictable but real life isn’t. Right now she’s having a lot of issues of her own and just doesn’t have the spoons to help me, which I am completely understanding of. My wife is always predictable to me because I married a rock (I need that rock or I’ll fly away.) I don’t know anyone else with that specific ability. I don’t trust anyone else. 

Is there other tricks you’ve used to come closer to reality? I’m really struggling and am afraid to keep going into the delusion.

I just got diagnosed with bipolar by a psychiatrist today. I have been putting it off for so long that I waited too late to save my marriage. However, I don't want to USE my new diagnosis as an EXCUSE for me emotionally abusing my wife for so long. Everyone on the other post was very blunt that I shouldn't do that. 

So, even though I am devastated about my marriage, I don't believe there is anything I can do at this point to salvage it. So I am working on myself now. A bit too late. I don't want to seem like the guy who picked out a trendy mental illness. I did get it confirmed though. And it's not from me hopping around. I talked to just one guy, he's in like, his late 70s.

I graduated in June (yay!!!) so I was referred to a psychiatrist outside of the university. At the end of my first appointment with my new psychiatrist, she asked me if I’d be willing to explore the possibility of a different diagnosis (while still staying on my current meds, 150 mg of Lamotrigine, because I told her I liked them) because sometimes medical professionals have different opinions. I said sure, but I was really caught off guard by this. My great grandmother and my second cousin on my dad’s side had both been diagnosed with bipolar disorder (which I didn’t find out until after I was diagnosed) and although I originally just thought I just had depression, being diagnosed with bipolar disorder instead wasn’t necessarily a surprise to me, more just like “Oh. Well, I guess that makes sense” and my significant other agreed with me. So I’m feeling kinda weird about the whole thing, but I guess I’m not totally opposed to the idea of a different diagnosis, because I do have a lot of bpd symptoms as well, but I’m wondering if anyone else has had this experience before and how it’s worked out for them.

bipolar,"Hi everyone, 

I was reading Heart Stopper tonight, and somehow I started crying. I started crying because I never had a friend group like that when I was in my teens. I did not get the normal teenage experience because I was severely mentally ill and I had undiagnosed autism. I had no friends, I did not get invited to parties, and I had an unstable home life.

It was literally my dream to have a friend group like that, or to have a girl best friend. I never got it, and I spent countless weekends alone while I got to watch everyone go to parties, dates, and get togethers. 

I feel really behind in some areas because I didn't get the socialization I needed for certain areas like friendships and serious relationships. 

 I'm 23 years old now, and I'm attempting to go back to school after dropping out last spring due to mental illness. I was not on the right medication, and I was discriminated at an internship interview. The sad part about that is I was suppose to graduate last spring, and all my hard work and pushing through went in the trash. 

I only made two friends in college, but the sad thing is that I see their Instagram stories of them going to concerts, bars, and the movies with other friends. I never get invited to anything. I get so lonely sometimes, and I don't know if I should cry or scream. 

I had to accept a lot of thing last year. I had to accept that I lost the life I wanted. I had to rethink on what my life was going to look like. I had to come to terms that I will have to work twice as hard as my peers just to get half way. I will have to find a way to build a freelance career and I have no idea how to start. I will also be in therapy for the rest of my life just to manage all three of my conditions. I will have to take meds that taste like a dogs butt for the rest of my life. 

I'm grieving for what I have lost, and I really hope there's a light at the end of the tunnel. So, does anyone relate?

bipolar,I have been aware I have cyclothymia since 2018 tho it probably started to manifest in the early 00s in my late teens. I am high functioning and am able to manage it well day to day especially since diagnosis gave me strategies for coping without meds. Recently however my dad has been experiencing dementia of unknown origins and the care burden on my mom is too high so I'm trying to help but I feel bad how relatively not functional I am when I have to care directly for more people than myself daily. I have specifically never gotten married or had kids bc I know that would be over my limit but I'm now overwhelmed trying to adapt.

My closest and best girl friend of almost 10 years and I don’t even know how to apologize about how our friendship has disintegrated.

bipolar,"Hello everyone,

Yes, I wrote this and then used AI to restructure it to sound less like a rant. I hope you’re all doing well. I’m a 23-year-old male, soon to be 24, with bipolar 2, who, 7-8 months ago, moved 800 miles across the country from New Jersey to southeast Georgia with my girlfriend. To provide some context, I worked in a cozy IT desk job for two years that accommodated my bipolar disorder very well. However, six months ago, I took a leap and left that job to move out of my grandparent’s home, and things have been quite challenging since then.

I don’t have a degree and carry about $30,000 in credit card/loan debt. Despite diligently applying to hundreds of jobs daily and seeking guidance from over 10+ IT and recruiting professionals to refine my resume, securing stable employment has been a struggle. My job history post-relocation includes a few low-level retail positions and one promising enterprise IT job, which I quit due to increased cycling in my bipolar disorder.

Unfortunately, I’ve found it hard to maintain jobs. Whether it’s unsuitable work environments or my reluctance to work excessive hours (55-65 hours a week), I’ve either quit or been let go. Presently, I’m in a relatively low-stress retail job, but the owner’s micromanagement exacerbates my rapid cycling, making it difficult to manage my health (yes, I have spoken to him about it, but he has a business to run and as accommodating as he has have been, he has made that very clear.)

Speaking of health, while I’ve historically managed my bipolar disorder well, since leaving the job where I felt content, finding work stability has been a challenge. I’m currently on Vraylar, and my therapist is suggesting that I consider applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) due to the worsening of my condition. However, I have reservations as I’ve only made a modest income (30-40K) in the past 5-6 years I have been working and worry about the viability of disability support.

Financially, my girlfriend and I collectively face monthly expenses of $1300 each for rent and food, in addition to my credit card debt. My therapist believes there are potential benefits to applying for Supplemental Security Income (SSI), even though my contributions to it have been limited due to my income.

At this juncture, I’m torn between seeking disability benefits for additional support and continuing the job search in hopes of finding a role that accommodates my health needs while ensuring financial stability. My grandfather suggests holding off on disability claims and persisting in finding a job that aligns better with my health.

I’m reaching out here seeking advice and insights. Should I explore disability benefits despite my financial concerns or focus on finding a job that better suits my health condition and financial needs?

Thank you for taking the time to read and for any guidance you can offer.",24M And Considering SSDI,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Support/Advice '}, {'a': ':shy:', 'e': 'emoji', 'u': 'https://emoji.redditmedia.com/r8r7jlred9za1_t5_2qnv4/shy'}]",r/bipolar,0.6739347389220144,-0.21034204962500036,-0.21034204962500036,0,1,1,0,0,BipolarBanter,-0.4203452324678521,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,3
bipolar,"I (25FtM) was diagnosed Bipolar 1 about a year ago and I haven't enrolled in classes in almost two years.  I was enrolled in classes last spring but ended up taking a medical leave of absence when I got my diagnosis. I'm applying for disability accommodation, but I'm not sure what to ask for. I'm stuck just on the question on the form: ""How does your disability impact your academic progress?"" I've always been really bad at asking for help when I need it. I was always raised to tough it out and not make ""excuses"", which clearly wasn't working. I know I can't do it alone anymore.

I haven't been in school since before my bipolar diagnosis and I still am having a hard time identifying what my moods mean and what I need, let alone knowing how to ask for help or knowing how it will affect me in school. I'm still adjusting medications too.

I've always struggled with finishing classes. I'd enroll in a major and then lose momentum a couple of months in, fail the classes, then change my major again. I also have unmedicated ADHD, so it was probably a bit of that and the undiagnosed bipolar affecting me. I've probably taken about 180 credits worth of classes between 5 majors. I have 71 credits and an A.A. to show for it.

I just want to know what kind of accommodations you guys have asked for and/or which ones really helped you the most. Or have any of you struggled with asking for help, too? Are there things at home that really helped you with school?

I'm enrolled at an online school, so I don't have any in-person lectures, which is nice. The classes are 8-week sessions instead of 16 weeks, so I can enroll in 2 classes at a time rather than 5. I like that structure a lot more than trying to study for 5 midterm/finals at the same time.

I don't have much of a support system in terms of family, they don't understand the concept of mental health very much, but I have close friends who try their best to understand and be supportive. They have mental health struggles of their own that weigh on them enough. We all try to be supportive of each other, but sometimes we just need to not talk about that stuff at all.
